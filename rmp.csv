45881,"Rand was a good guy, really... he was. But I felt he had an alter-ego when he left to go home and grade. His expectations and how he picked apart his students papers was simply not fair. Again, great guy but avoid this class with him!!!",awful
45881,"He is brilliant in his field, but expects his students to perform at high levels, with unrealistic expectations. Only by a miracle did I get an A, and that was after a heavy curve. He does care about his students though, as he gives lots of time in class for work, while he goes around giving tips and answering questions.",poor
45881,"He has a major in philosophy which is why all the papers you have to write are based on philosophy. As long as your paper agrees with what he thinks you will get a good grade. Otherwise the class is boring and he talks for an hour about nonsense but it is mandatory to attend otherwise your grade will drop.",awful
45881,"I thought his class was extremely hard but despite it all, I became a confident writer. People on here say 'you can only get a c on a paper' WRONG. I got an A and a B. You just have to be in it to win it. If you want to get an A, get a different teacher. If you want learn, Go for Rand. He made Eng. 110 worth something.",good
45881,"I recently just finished taking Comp 110 with Rand and it was the hardest class of my freshman semester. He takes it way too serious for a 100 level class. 80% of the class is papers so you would think you control the grade you get, right? Wrong.  He will tear apart your paper and give you a bad grade despite your efforts. I worked hard for a C.",poor
45881,"Steven Rand is a nice person and really interesting to hear him speak. I am always inspired after a lecture. However, never expect to get anything higher than a C. You can think your paper is perfect but, he will tear it apart in seconds. Take a different professor if you don't want to put 9 hours of work into a paper you get an 'average' grade on.",good
45881,"Hard class ",good
45881,"He graded a 100 level class like we were all English majors in a 300 or above level class. Never got higher than a C on a paper. I went to the writing center for every paper. Very unclear in instructions and hard to approach with questions. Don't take the class from him.",awful
45881,"Tough grader on papers make sure you do your work and drafts. Participation grades save you in the long run. Dont miss class and do your work. Go to the tutor center helps alot",poor
45881,"Do not take English 110 with Rand. I don't feel any better at writing due to his confusing grading style. ",poor
45881,"Bottom line Rand needs to retire before he ruins everyone's GPA's.  He thinks he knows so much about English and thinks it is his job to make essay assignments unneeded riddles.  He answers questions with questions and likes to talk trash about high school English teachers; hating on the high school teachers ironically makes it like high school. FR",awful
45881,"He will only give your paper a C. It does not matter if it is good or not. Work extremely hard if you plan on passing.",good
45881,"one of the worst professors at UND. Extremely hard grader and expects to much in a 100 level class. Thinks that everyone's papers should be masterpieces. No matter how long i spent on a paper i couldnt get higher than a C. Only reason i got a B in the class was because i never missed a class. ",awful
45881,"This class is so pointless its ridiculous.  I'm in the class currently (only because its required.) The class has no relevance to anything in life.  Rand is a ****, the class is so boring. He could make the class so much better by writing papers that actually have meaning to  them instead of what some philosopher said.  Textbook reading is hard!!  ",awful
45881,"Horrible professor. He does not believe in A's.  Thinks that other teachers grade too easily.  Answers your questions with other questions that do not help you.  Teaches you irrelevant material that you will never use again. Worst professor I have ever had.",awful
45881,"Worst professor ever. He asked me personal questions that were uncomfortable, made me feel stupid when I asked questions, and overall discouraged me. Do not take english 125 from him.",awful
45881,"I attend his Business and Technical Writing course. Rand humiliates people for not understanding assignments when they ask. Very egotistical, rude to those who need help, very difficult work, hard grader -even on those who are following directions. I highly recommend waiting to take this class from anyone else. Not worth losing points on your GPA.",awful
45881,"He was a very hard grader, but he graded on improvement throughout the semester, not on how great of a  greater you were (I mean he obviously graded on how good of a writer you were, but it was more on how much you progressed). I learned a lot from him. I am even taking me next english class with him. Definitely take his course if you can!",awesome
45881,"Professor Steven Rand is very unclear and grades very hard. If you are in his English classes, drop if you want something less than a C. He hates that 'students were graded too easy in high school' so in response to that, he likes to fail his students.",poor
45881,"He is terrible! If you have him drop him IMMEDIATELY! He is mean, and an extremely hard grader!!!!",awful
45881,"Awful. Horrible grading.",awful
45881,"I wish I could give him a zero",awful
45881,"Not good.",poor
45881,"This was a tough class. I expected all college classes to be like this, but since most are not it was somewhat refreshing to have a professor push me this much. If you are willing to put in the work for Mr. Rand you will reep the benefits. If not, then take this class from someone else.",awesome
45881,"He is a unruly professor. He grades on how he feels your ideas are. There is never a right answer, papers can ALWAYS use improvement. I would not recommend him to anyone wanting a grade over a C, even to get that you must put in an excessive amount of time into each paper.",poor
45881,"He is confusing in every aspect: in lecture, in assignments and in critiquing. His assignments are mundane and never change.  I expected to explore writing and become better.  He is an impossible grader, espcially because he grades on how HE feels about your ideas, not on grammer or content.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.",poor
45881,"Worst teacher I have had at UND. Sorry I don't have a PhD in English. His grading style is way too rough for a 125 class. nobody in my class has an A. I have put in 3x more hours for this class than any other but still this class is my worst grade. If possible, avoid this teacher!",poor
45881,"worst experience of my life. expects way too much for a 100 level course. take this class if you want to spend 15 hours on a three page paper and still get a C-. ridiculous grading policies.",average
45881,"For as much of a waste as UNIV 101 is, he did an ok job at keeping things interesting.  Avoid UNIV 101 altogether if you can.",good
45881,"His expectations are high for a required 100-level class, especially since most who take it aren't English majors. To his credit, he's smart and gives good feedback. I wouldn't recommend him to a freshman.",good
45881,"Steven rand just a joke!! and so incrediablely socially awkward! do not take this class unless you like to fail out of college! He gives you directions for a paper but grades on whatever is on his mind that day his grading makes no sense and no one has ever gotten an A in one of his classes yet.... if you dont believe me he will tell you this.",awful
45881,"I struggled through his class. First- he's a lawyer, so he'll lead you on making you think one thing without actually promising anything.  Second- he'll give you about 20 different instructions on one paper and he'll grade it by how he's feeling. Stupid class, I worked so hard and managed a B but he told me that I had &quot;weak writing.&quot; Avoid him!",awful
45881,"Hey be nice. Yeah, he's hard to understand, and a very harsh grader, but he's a teacher and at least he's doing his job (of course, everyone including me would love easier, more comprehendable classes) just be greatful he's willing to put up with everyone's bull hoping that he helped at least one student improve in literature.",good
45881,"Stevevn Rand was the absolute worst professor i have ever had.  He's without a doubt the hardest teacher you can take for any english classes.  He grades extremely hard, and not at the level of a 100 class. Also Steven Rand is the biggest &quot;Creeper&quot; he makes everyone around him feel extremely uncomfortable.",poor
45881,"This is the hardest 100 level class ever. It doesn't matter if you dedicate your life to this class, you still won't get an A! Take it a another semester or with a different professor. His directions are unclear. He goes against everything the book says, but tells you to use the book.  He's confusing, a hard grader, and a different guy. STAY AWAY!!",poor
45881,"I am currently in this class.  I took this, because I was told it was supposed to be easier than 120.  I regret staying in this class with Rand as my Professor.  He is nice and pretty smart, but his grading is ridiculous.  He is the hardest grader I have ever encountered.DONT take him, if you are taking this class as a general basically. LISTEN.",average
45881,"I took 125 because I heard it was easier than 120 unless you get a certain professor. Well this is that professor. He's a nice guy but expects perfection and is out of touch with reality. The class is boring and hard, and the book is expensive. First paper was 3-4 pages, last will be 15 with each in between getting larger. Would NOT recommend him.",poor
45881,"This was by far the best learning experience I have had at UND. He is a hard grader but he helps by marking your papers with serious suggestions. I feel that many mistake his marks for personal attacks when he is only trying to bring the best out in his students. My writing skills have improved a hundred fold. I would recommend him to anyone.",awesome
45881,"I should have read these comments before I took this class. This was by far the worse teacher I have had! He makes you feel dumb and expects way to much for a 100 level class. Worked my butt off to get a B in the course! If you can, please switch to another teacher, you will be thankful you did!! He expects everyone is an English Major!",awful
45881,"I suggest never taking him...i read the comments on here but figured it wouldnt be so bad so stayed in...wrong move...trust me..get out of the class ASAP...his instructions were never clear and he made you write the paper then changed his assignment my advice for the writers group is to just write a bunch of crap because you'll rewrite it anyway",awful
45881,"No Comments",awful
45881,"horrible teacher, i had to transfer out of state i hated this guy so much",awful
45881,"He was a very unfair teacher... i suggest NOT taking him!",awful

45881,"I think he is a great guy to just talk about music, and fun stuff outside of school, but he never answers questions you have, and gives like a couple B's in the class the rest...  you know...",poor
45881,"what can i say about rand....those of you who hate him so much should be lucky that you didn't have to endure his class five days a week for six weeks for an hour and a half each day....YOU SHOULD FEEL SOMEWHAT LUCKY!",awful
45881,"This man is the devil trapped in human form. It is currently 2:42am the day before this final paper and I want to gouge my eyes out. If I could give some advice to future students I would recommend dropping at the soonest possible moment and save yourself some time before drop day or prepare to spend 8 hours writing papers to get a C-.I despise him",awful
45881,"Impossible to a get above a C- on anything!!! He treats you like you are an employee of a Rocket science nasa program or something......Nice guy but a lil out of touch with reality",poor
45881,"he sucks...and he wants you to fail at life...stay away.. far away...",awful
45881,"It is impossible to get a good grade.  If you get a B, congradulations, i think you're a first. he is an unfair grader.  I went to the writing center when he worked and had him look at my paper, made all the changes he told me to do and still go a C.  I spent way too much time on his papers.  If you have him, get out now!!!!!!",awful

601915,"The course is difficult, but doable. Mr. Farm will help you, but the key to this course is to use  math learning center. He is a professor that wants to see you pass so he tries to help as much as possible.",good
601915,"Everyday there is a WebAssign assignment given out (very time consuming and they don't help you on the exams). The three exams he gives are extremely HARD!, all I can say is just practice ... a lot. I got a F on my first exam and had to ace the rest to get an A overall. lastly, the final will wreck you, the girl sitting next to me cried during it.",poor
601915,"Mr. Farm is one of the nicest people you will meet. WebAssign assignments get handed out every day after class to practice problems and a quiz usually appears every day at class. Do a lot of practice questions for the 3 midterm tests. For the final he makes you understand the concepts instead of memorizing problems. Put the work in, get an A.",good
601915,"Tests are hard because they never matched up with notes and lectures. On the final test, we had to get a 70% on it or we didn't pass the Everything that you think is gonna be on the test, is not. Expect homework 4 days a week. Would not recommend.",awful
601915,"Mr. Farm is the best math teacher I have ever had. He is super funny and very passionate about what he does. There is a quiz almost every day in class, but it is not the end of the world if you miss one.",awesome

Also, there is a quiz in class pretty much every day, so go! The homework is challenging and time consuming, but the tests are much easier which is nice. He isn't the best at explaining material, but ok.",average
601915,"Terrible teacher all around. Had him my first year in college for math and got stuck with him again my junior year and nothing changed.. he maybe even got worse..",poor
601915,"Nice person but absolutely sucks at teaching math. This class is supposed to be for students who are below the average math scores but he makes it so difficult. I'm bad at math to start with and he doesn't help. Avoid him at all costs.",awful
601915,"I took Math 92 and 93 in one semester, it was very fast paced. If you missed any class you would be behind for a while. All in all he was a good teacher, I think a lot of people didn't like moving at that pace and in turn disliked him.",average
601915,"Took this class for interest, also was the first math course in College. It was very hard to start with, extensive and new HW every class(Webassign), Prepare to do them, with solid understanding. attendence are vital. Test are very based on in class assignments and lecture examples.",good
601915,"Farm has homework almost nightly, but it nothing that wasn't able to be done quickly for the most part.  His final test accounted for the most percentage of the points in the class so studying is mandatory if you want to pass this class.",good
601915,"If you don't show your work or show that you double checked your answers he'll give you a zero, even if you got the question right.  Also you can't skip because he does in class practice that you turn in at the end of the class.",awful

601915,"Kinda quirky but he's a good guy that cares. Show up everyday for free points. Quizzes almost every week (turned into group quizzes by the end of the semester). Test very similar to quizzes. Homework almost every day and it is much harder than what you will see on the quizzes/test though if you ask for extensions you'll get it every time. Math On!",awesome
601915,"Kind of weird, makes corny jokes all the time but one of the better math professors I've had. He's passionate about the subject and it shows. He spends extra time making sure that his students understand the reasons behind why you do certain steps and, for me, it was helpful in my understanding. Recommended.",good
601915,"This class is  a giant headache. So far, we've had over 30 assignments(only worth 20% of grade) that each take hours to complete, because Stuart puts many problems that we never went over in class . On top of that, we have weekly comprehensive quizzes that are inconsistent in difficulty and points. Simply, I pity anyone who has to take this class.",poor
601915,"I would not recommend this professor if you' re not strong in math. You should expect to do homework almost every night. New homework assignment after each class. Doesn't give traditional exams but weekly quizzes for points. Text book assigned was of little help. Homework take hours to complete for only small portion of grade.",average
601915,"Stuart Farm, so far, has been the worst professor I have had. He grades so harshly that it is almost impossible to get even a C. (At one point I had a 48%) (& Im the average A/B student) He gives weekly quizzes and gives time consuming homework. I would not recommend him.",poor
601915,"He is the worst teacher that I have had for the past ten years. He goes way overboard with trying to explain things, and when he does explain things, it doesn't show up on the test or quizzes. There are many other students in my class that have no idea what is going on. Don't take any of his classes. You have to teach yourself the lessons.",poor
601915,"Stuart Farm is a fantastic guy that is very easy to get along with. Greets you with a smile every day and is excited to see you each and every day and tries to make the class fun. Defenitly introduce yourself to him. He is confusing in his explaining of concepts. He tends to over-explain where it gets confusing. He is a very respectable person.",average
601915,"Stuart Farm is a nice guy and cares about his students, but that doesn't result in effective teaching or keeping the class engaged. He doesn't seem to understand that students taking Math146 are the least likely to raise there hand and contribute, and you can't have a discussion with 100 people. For grades, watch him like a hawk and email him ASAP.",poor
601915,"Mr. Farm is a good teacher, but is not quite clear on the types of questions we need to go over. The homework and in-class assignments are a lot tougher than the actual exams.",good
601915,"Mr. Farm was a nice guy and tried to make everyone laugh. But points wise I had an A, because of his curve I had a C. He never explained anything and if you asked him a question he never seemed to answer it. I would avoid taking his class, unless you want to fail. ",poor
601915,"Professor Farm is a nice guy and wants you to do well, but he is very confusing. Avoid him if possible. I took Math93 with him, and although it's very simple math, he makes if somehow difficult. I hadn't had math since my junior year of high school, so I had to take this. His explanations make things more difficult. Have to teach yourself. ",average

Gave me multiple zero's on test problems for not doing the question 'his way' even thought the answer was correct. ",awful
601915,"Mr. Farm knows math and he wants you to learn.  Don't expect him to just give you the answers. He will answer any and every question and clarify anything you need.  Attend class, do the assignments and you'll do fine.  Gives 2 tests (10 questions each) and final (15 questions). Super nice, nerdy guy who's motto is 'Math on!' ",good
601915,"Terrible at teaching, absolutely no help when asking questions, and was rude to his own students.",awful
601915,"Mr. Farm is in the top 3 of the worst teachers I have ever had. He assigns work that you did not cover on web assign (the worst way to do math homework). He is not very helpful, and is very odd. Avoid this professor at all costs, he will make an easy subject hard to comprehend.",awful
601915,"Like others have said, he seems like a great guy, and is very willing to help his students.  That said, he spends most of every lecture period answering questions from current or previous assignments and then only lectures on new material for 10 min.  So I basically have had to teach myself the material which makes it super tough and time consuming",average
601915,"Is a very nice teacher, but hard to understand his lectures. He expects you to know too much coming into the class, and goes far over the students head's while lecturing.

I could not understand anything he was teaching. My girlfriend didn't even know and she was in calc 2. Over taught everything beyond most of the class' knowledge. ",poor
601915,"Mr. Farm is hands down just not clear in any area of the classes he teaches. It seems that there is about a 5050 split between students who get what he is teaching and those who don't. I would not recommend taking a class with him.",poor

Attendance is not required but helps a lot!",awesome

Waste of my hard earned money!",poor

The reason why I always needed to ask for help is because he would never really show how to do the problems. He went way too fast, even though he says he'll slow it down until people understand. Very frustrating!!",average

I got an A, so I am not just a jaded student who got his GPA wrecked. His giant ego is second only to that of his minion TA's who love to scare current students to death. Switch Universities before taking this. ",awful
277557,"I hated this class!  Shively has a LOT of knowledge on the subject, which is great but without recording the class or having a photographic memory there is no way you will pass. His tests are ridiculously tricky and you basically just have to guess. Oh wait even if you do he will mark you wrong on every test.... EVEN If you are right!  ",poor
277557,"Awesome class! Prepares you well for med school. Those who bag on this class obviously don't try hard enough to pass. Shively was a great professor, so funny and willing to help you out and clarify  concepts. Such a great class, lab was so fun!",awesome
277557,"Shively was a really good teacher, but his tests were brutal. He changed his style of tests constantly, which meant a surprise.",average
277557,"Very difficult class. Shively know what he's talking about and teaches to show off his knowledge. Tests are incredibly hard and very tricky. He doesn't test your knowledge - he tests your guessing ability. ",poor
277557," Shively and his minions (lab instructors and STA's) are more interested in furthering their ego than teaching.  Worst educators I've ever experienced.  This entire class was a complete waste of time and money.  Take from another University if you don't want to ruin your GPA or plan on getting into graduate school.",awful
277557,"Shively's Intro to Anatomy class kinda felt more like an Intro Med School class. People on here are not kidding when they say it's difficult! You NEED the textbook to pass. All I can say is STUDY STUDY STUDY. If you do poorly on one test (of his five or so) he will let you replace one with the final. Go to class, read your notes, read the text. ",good
277557,"Shively is a nice guy but is not very organized or structured. You pretty much just show up to class to ask him questions. Just ready the book thoroughly and memorize the objectives. Very time consuming class and tests and final are difficult.",average
277557,"Shively is a unique fellow. I like him. He knows what he's talking about. He wrote the book on anatomy, literally.  The textbook anyway. The subject is tough, there is a lot to learn. He won't dumb it down, so if you're not putting in enough effort you won't pass the class. Shively does do his best to motivate his students and help them understand",good
277557,"Michael Shively seems to know a great deal about the study of Anatomy. This being said, he is the worst professor I have ever encountered. He was frequently absent throughout the course. Additionally, he would often respond to student inquiries very rudely. The lectures are useless and the tests are unjustifiably difficult. ",awful
277557,"Difficult class. It takes a lot of time and effort. One of the most rewarding classes I have ever taken. If you enjoy learning, you will love this class. If you want an easy 'A' don't take it.",awesome

277557,"Take from somewhere else. You will tear your hair out at the amount of work and time you will spend. I lived in the lab and studied like crazy, but did not pass. The tests are a huge downfall. You will not regret taking it from another university.",poor
277557,"If you do not have a job, and all you do is school, this class may be slightly easier for you. But it would be a lie to say he is a good teacher, or grades fairly. The study guides, and going to class contained maybe 10% of what is actually on the tests. The average test scores are around 35%.",poor
277557,"Great teacher! Dr. Shively is legit! He says exactly what he means and follows through. He tells you exactly what you need to do in order to succeed. DO IT! Read the book. DO THE OBJECTIVES! Read the clinicals. Yeah it's hard. So make sure you work hard! Don't under estimate this class but it will be the best class if you put in the work required.",awesome
277557,"Shively is a good lecturer in that what he says is engaging and interesting to learn.  His tests though are horrendous. He does exactly what they say not to do when giving a test, and makes it so that everyone fails.  This is just the intro. class, yet it felt like the real thing minus the lab.  Do not take this class!",poor

It's hard material,but Shively does a great job of helping you understand, but you need to study the book!  He'll help you if you work hard.  You'll love the class if you do!",good
277557,"Dr. Shively knows all about anatomy, but he's not a good teacher. His lectures consist of him making crude jokes, and making a point that he's smarter than the students. His tests consist of tricky questions, and he prides himself on low class averages. It's possible to get an A, you just have to dedicate your life to it and memorize the book.",awful
277557,"Shively knows anatomy. He's the best there is as far as that goes. But he wears terrible scores as a badge of honor. This means that his tests are very difficult and designed to be tricky. He wants his students to dedicate their lives to his class and you'll need to do just that in order to get an A. Toughest class I've ever had.",average
277557,"I knew going in that this would be hard but this was insane. Dr. Shively is a really nice guy, and he went out of his way to help me out. That said, he has an ego the size of the school and it seems like he is proud of the fact that his is the hardest class on campus. He makes it TOO hard. Beware nursing students, he doesn't care much for you.",average
277557,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS,If you plan on having a life outside of anatomy! If you want to do well, plan on committing to 12 hours a week for both lab and lecture. Shively and his minions delight in making students feel dumb, and sucking up all their time. Don't feed the beast; take this course somewhere else!",average
277557,"Doctor Shively is an amazing professor. The best I have had at UVU. Anatomy is a very hard class but Doc makes it clear what you need to know. Very clear and wants students to succeed and learn. His tests are difficult but ultimately really help you learn. Overall I really enjoyed this class although it was extremely hard.",awesome
277557,"Don't believe the hype. The monster grade curve will atone for all your mistakes as long as you give your best. There's NO reason to fail this class or take it twice. DOn't beleive it. Find a good study crew and work hard.",average
277557,"As an introductory course, particularly for a student not in pursuit of a medical career, this class was very distressing.  I read the reviews here before taking this class and had a 'can do it' attitude but in retrospect I am asking, 'Why did I do that to myself?'  The class average was around 40% on tests!  Stressful...",average
277557,"Took this class and studied my butt off..of course to no avail. I am convinced that he finds pleasure in knowing people struggle and fail. I would not take another Anatomy course from UVU. I have come to hate Anatomy and after taking Homan's 2320, I changed my major.",average
277557,"Shively is awesome! Hands-down the best class I have ever taken. Super helpful and kind. Knows everything about the subject. Willing to help outside of class or answer any question without making you feel dumb. Work hard-get a good study partner. Study exactly what he tells you from the book. An A is totally possible!!",awesome
277557,"Dr. Shively is AWESOME!! Hands-down the best class I have ever taken. Requires A LOT to get an A, but it's worth it. Study exactly what he says-don't just memorize-understand it well enough to explain it to someone else. Get a good study partner and work like you've never worked and you'll get SO much out of it. One complaint-doesn't use Canvas!",awesome
277557,"HORRIBLE teacher! I took this class via TV, so I was able to watch and rewatch the lectures. I took notes, attended every lecture, etc. The tests had very few things from class on them. I felt that attending class was pointless, because he went over things that weren't even kind of on the test. I felt like he was just trying to weed people out.",awful
277557,"People whine and moan about this class, but that's because you have to WORK HARD in this class, and people are not committed, or they are too lazy.  This class has been accused of many things, but understand this:  It is the most rewarding class you will ever take, and will prepare you for your medical career, hands down.",awesome
277557,"NEVER EVER TAKE ANATOMY WITH Shively!! He plays guitar, but it doesn't apply to anatomy! In my opinion, he makes fun of the students and probably just wants money and business. The tests and the requirements that he pushed students to take are ridiculous!",awful
277557,"This was the hardest and the most rewarding class you will ever take.  You can practically applied the material taught in class into reality.  Be motivated and dedicated to this class and an A is possible.  If you work for it you can get it.  Must love to read to understand to survive this class.",poor

277557,"good teacher but the hardest class you will take",good
277557,"This class is not an easy class.  Shively expects more than just memorization.  He wants students to think critically about the material.  Once you realize he expects more than memorization, it makes the class more bearable and interesting.  He's a good instructor, though not the most helpful one on one.",good
277557,"HArdest class you will ever take... That being said, also the most rewarding. Shively is the man! Great teacher, definetely teaches you to think things through. Combo of him and homan was best learning experience I have had at uvu. Dedicate EVERYTHING to this class, and an A is possible",awesome
277557,"Shively's Anatomy is about the hardest class you can take at UVU. He is very good at explaining things and knows almost everything about the subject. His tests are very difficult due to the wording of his questions and the vast amount of information you need to know. He is willing to help if asked. If you want to know the subject well take it here.",awesome
277557,"Shively is a nice guy but as a teacher he is misguided. He seems to have something against the health field (specifically nurses). Anyways, his tests are unclear with sometimes more than one answer possible but you have to pick Shively's choice. I got an A in the class (precurve) but regret taking the course with Shively - take it somewhere else",average
277557,"Shively is actually an awesome teacher, but demanding.  Study what he tells you to, but know it backwards and forwards.  Questions are tricky.  I earned an A w/o curve.  I know from friends grades that the curve is very generous.  This was my only class and I wasn't working, so it was my life.  It was hard, but I feel prepared for PA school.",good
277557,"If you've heard this is the hardest class you will take, you're right! But it will be the most rewarding class you will ever take. I'm in nursing school right now, and thanks to Shively i know my stuff forward and backward. I got an A with the curve but i dedicated my life to Anatomy! Good Luck, but be prepared to eat, sleep, breath Anatomy!",good
277557,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS FROM SHIVELY. His quizzes/midterm/final are ridiculous. He seems to get some kind of entertainment by seeing students squirm and struggle.

277557,"The trio of professors; Shively, Holman, and Bracken, shaped my love for human science. I am now a biomed engineering student which requires a rigorous attention to detail. Bracken helped teach how to think. Shively underlined the importance of being meticulous.  Holman instilled passion and taught me that med school is not the answer to everything",awesome

Honestly the worst test giver i have ever heard of. if you take this class be ready to work your butt off and not score well. lab is great lecture is ridiculous.",average

277557,"Dr. Shively has taught for so long that his lectures seem to be memorized, so everything on the tests is mentioned in class. However, that does not mean they are easy at all. The average was in the 30s. You will learn a lot, and if you study you should do fine. In a way his class tests more on ability to answer trick questions than on knowledge.",awesome
277557,"Read the book extensively.  Obj's, Q's @ back of book, and ask things in class.  Well above avg on quizzes, C on final and got A.  Dr. Shively is demanding, but thorough and kind. DO xtra credit!",awesome

If you are just getting your Associates, take another class!!",awful
277557,"I took his online course and it was awful.  He offered us ZERO assistance and did not respond to one single email all semester.  I think it's unfair we can't review our exams to see what we missed and why.  He is harsh in his grading and likes to trick you on the quizzes and exams.  The high in our class was a 62% so he graded on a curve.",poor
277557,"Dr. Shively is amazing! The class is hard, but you get a lot out of it. I am hoping for an amazing curve so I can pass. Best day ever when he plays the guitar. He is laid back, easily approachable, just pay attention in class and don't chat. Get to know him, he is amazing! The class is really hard, but it will prepare you for an awesome career.",awesome

He seems gruff, but not and tests actually from text of lecture book.",average

277557,"Dr. Shively is an excellent teacher- the fact that he and prof. Homan wrote their own books shows their commitment to their profession.  He is extremely knowledgeable and does a great job at pushing his students to truly think of solutions that we may face in our future.  Overall, read the book, do the practice questions- and learn how he asks Q's.",awesome

Doc will answer any question you have. Spent over an hour with me outside class answering questions. If your'e going into the medical field, take this class at UVU.",awesome
277557,"Many hate Dr. Shively but I really like him and the tests teach you to actually think. All tests from other teachers are a cinch after this. Work hard, don't fall behind or you'll never catch up. Expect to have no social life, live in the lab, read the text, always go to class, get into study groups! Read text before class and ask questions.",awesome

If you procrastinate, don't have basic study discipline, and if you just go through the motions--you will hate this professor, because he actually expects you to do something called work.  Welcome to college.",awesome
277557,"Dr. Shively is smart, and his class (and tests) are HARD but you probably already heard. He's a good teacher who knows his stuff, buckle down and learn how to study or wuss out and go somewhere else for this class. My favorite day was when he brought in his guitar.",good
277557,"I worked very hard in this class. It required a lot of work for being an Intro class but felt like a higher level class. His tests were very tricky. I didn't like how he would ramble on and you didn't know what to study. Find a different professor!",awful
277557,"This class is the hardest thing I have ever done. You will study the text till you can no longer read. But I don't regret it.

His quizzes and tests are insanely hard, but he grades on a curve so it's easy to get a good grade. My only complaint is that I had no idea what my grade was til after the course ended. But anyone who says stay away just didn't work hard enough.",awesome

277557,"If I were you, I would take a critical thinking class before taking this class.  Half of the time I wasn't sure what he was asking for.  When the class average is 40%(ish) or lower, then it is the there is something the teacher is not doing right. This class is insane.  Plan on studying for at least 20 hours a week for this class alone. Good luck!",average
277557,"I cannot believe how much people complain and moan about this class!!.  Yes it is very hard and challenging but you are given everything you need to succeed.  Absolutely fantastic teacher!!!!",awesome
277557,"No one should ever complain about his anatomy class. Sure its hard but he gives you the tools to succeed its just a matter if you use them. If you plan on being in the medical field this class is a great eye opener to see what it is like. I highly reccommend his class. He is an amazing teacher and you will learn a ton.",average
277557,"It's funny reading all the ratings. He's very hard, there's no way around that. But it all depends on your work ethic and attitude. If you are committed to working hard and have a good attitude about him and anatomy, you'll do fine. It's graded on a curve which helps a lot.",average
277557,"Amazing teacher! He is very smart and his tests are challenging. There is a curve at the end, but you still need to work hard. It can be an imtimidating class when you first start because its a lot of information to cover in a lower division class, but if your going into the medical field or grad school its worth it. Good Luck!",good
277557,"It makes me laugh to see everybody complaining about Dr. Shively. He is one of the best instructors I have ever had, and is very fair. He even curved my whole class up 25 points at the end of the semester.  If you can't get a good grade with a 25% boost, you shouldn't be a science major.",good
277557,"I would have done better if Lab and Lecture for this class worked together and taught the same thing at the same time.",average
277557,"If you are looking to go into anything w/ the medical field you need to take Shivley's class! It is hard, but if you study hard you will do fine. He's a great teacher and very funny.",awesome
277557,"He is a very good teacher, his quizzes are extreamly hard though. This is not a class that you can just slide by in. You have to put in tons of time and effort.  He is very helpful, and cares about his students so much! He wants us to do well, and understands that his class is very hard. He wants us to really know our stuff. Great but hard teacher",good
277557,"This course is super hard for an intro class. The majority of the class was failing all quizzes and tests. He would teach us the simple things and then test us on the more complex things that weren't ever explained in class. Good luck!",poor
277557,"Dr. Shively is the author of 3 of the books you have to purchase.  so you go to class he gets paid to teach you then he chooses which text you have to buy, and of course he wants to put more money in his pocket!!!",awful
277557,"Do not take this class unless you plan to become a doctor!  He pushes you way harder than it is worth for a lower level class.  In fact I think the professors think it is an upper level class.  You can take anatomy online from another college and trust me it is much easier! Also you have to put in way to much time for a 4 credit class!!!",awful
277557,"One of the top two professors of my college experience.  Dr. Shively cares about helping students learn.  He is one of the few teachers at UVU that pushes his students because he wants them to realize their potential.  He is extremely fair with his grading and anyone who says otherwise didn't put the time or effort into the class.",awesome
277557,"For all of those who say this class is unfair and too hard...you probably didn't put in the necessary amount time.  Doc Shively is an extremely good teacher and he is very clear about you need to know for his tests.  I recommend taking this class with a &quot;lighter load&quot; or during the summer because you do need to put in the time to be successful!!",awesome
277557,"it is a good class, but just be prepared to work at it like crazy!!!! I really think Shively is a good teacher, but he is a hard one, so don't go into it expecting a mildly challenging class! study his book CAREFULLY. his tests are hard, but after a while you can start to see how he writes them and study for them accordingly and ASK QUESTIONS",good
277557,"I have never written a bad review about a professor before, but Shively is honestly one of the worst professors I have ever had.  He is extremely arrogant, extremely disorganized, doesn't follow his own schedule, it takes forever for you to get your tests back, in all honesty, avoid him if you can, you don't even learn anything with him.",awful
277557,"Easy class.  Take good notes, study throughout the semester to avoid the big push at the end.  I studied maybe 1 hour a week, and 5 hours the week before the final and got an A even before the 20 point curve.",awesome

277557,"Shively is AWESOME! Absolutely loved the class! I am not an extremely smart person, but put forth the effort, and got an A in the class. I don't get how people say he is unfair. Its those people who are trying to get out of studying and get an easy A. Study, devote your life to it and you'll do fine. I HIGHLY recommend Shively! He was the BEST!!!:)",awesome
277557,"He is just way too smart for his own good.I stuied my butt off and I still did terrible. You learn a lot but still do crappy on the tests. This class was way too hard for being an intro class.",awesome
277557,"Shively was one of the worst teachers I've ever had.  He's extremely arrogant, and believes he is god's gift to anatomy.  He is not there to teach, he's there to prove to you how smart he is.  Luckily, I ended up with an A because I stayed ahead of the curves, but that was no thanks to him.",awful
277557,"Shively is a great instructor and really knows his stuff. His quizzes are pretty difficult but not impossible to get a good score on. Use good, I'm mean very good test taking skills but studying hard is the key and don't get discouraged. Also, take advantage of every opportunity that he gives for extra credit. It will pay off",awesome

277557,"Class was very interesting and Shively keeps you entertained.  The class requires a LOT of effort though, but if you work hard it will pay off, there is a big curve at the end so the goal is to just stay above the average (which tends to be around 40-60%). Would not recommend taking this class with other classes that would require a lot of time...",average
277557,"Love this professor- lectures are humorous, informative and interesting with anecdotes designed to clarify and stick.  Tests are the devil, the wording is tricky, requires more knowledge than was given or contained in the book.  But, big curve at the end (I averaged high 50's, low 60's, & got an A.)  Still, love Shively- great guy.",good
277557,"Make sure to take all easy classes if you are going to take this class. This was the hardest introduction class I have taken. Lectures are awesome, he knows his anatomy and he is always keeping the mood light in the classroom. Tests and quiz's are impossible to do good on. Take the class and study hard. Major curve at the end.",good

277557,"Words tests so they are next to impossible to understand. And students do not receive results of tests a quizzes till sometimes a month after it was taken. Very hard to study for the next test/quiz when you don't know how you did on the first one.",poor

277557,"This class is ridiculous. Shively is a trickster, just cause you know the everything about the question, doesn't mean you'll get it right. If you want to memorize a 500 page text book then take this class. Also, plan on going to open lab EVERY night from 10pm-12. But yes, huge curve at the end.",average
277557,"Don't be fooled by the songs and jokes, this dude doesn't mess around when it comes time to take a test.  I studied my arse off and never got better than a 70% on a test. Took it again from Dr. Bayer and did MUCH better.",average

Take it at BYU, take it somewhere else. He is obssessed with the subject,even wrote songs about it!way too hard!",poor
277557,"HARD! tons of time spent studying for this class. he makes it entertaining and makes the material comprehensiable, but his test are CRAZY! just stick it out until the end NO MATTER what. at the end you will see a HUGE curve and as long as you put the time into it, your grade might not reflect it at the moment but at the end...its victory",average
277557,"Let's be honest.  His tests are rediculously hard.  You would think after giving a 30 point curve on the 2nd test he would get a clue, but he didn't.  he makes it unbelievebly difficult and demanding on your time.  He is a great teacher and makes lecture really fun.  If your going to take him be prepared to eat, sleep, breathe anatomy.",average

277557,"No matter who you take it from, anatomy is not an easy class.  Shively is very entertaining and makes lectures fun to go to.  He is very interested in his students and tries to know everyone by name.  If you do you part and study your butt off you'll love this class!",good
277557,"THis guy is an effective teacher, however, his course is quite demanding on time and effort to pass with a semi-decent grade. I work full time and do not have 30 hours  of study time to put in to this freakin class.",good
277557,"I heard this was the hardest class ever.  I got an A, but there was a lot of memorizing, but what the hell do you expect when you learn anatomy.  Doc Shively was great!  WAY FREAKIN SMART, and knows his stuff!!  When you figure out how he tests the tests are easy if you study a little!  Great teacher though this class was great!",awesome
277557,"his class is hard but if you have to take anatomy, take if from the best. he writes the test for the other anatomy teachers so you might as well get the info from the source. be prepared to hate yourself and do NOT take other hard classes with this schedule. theres only so much time to eat, sleep and study uvsc anatomy.",good
277557,"He is the most amazing teacher you can ask for.  He has a ton of students every semester, but he tries to help you individually with any questions.  You have to spend a lot of time studying, but its an amazing subject and totally worth it.  Anyone who says different is a total whiner.",awesome

So quit spending dad's dollar and put your face in a book. You get what you earn. Dr. Shively is the best teacher I've had yet. Very helpful with any question, any time!",awesome
277557,"I consider myself to be a great student, but this class was too much. I had to put in 35-40 hours a week of study and class time for a 4 credit hour class. I had to use his book that he wrote that was not edited and had no color. One day in class he said &quot;I can not beleive how stupid this class is&quot;. Horrible teacher that is only there for himself.",awful
277557,"Dr. Shively is awesome. He makes class so interesting. This class is really hard, but I learned so much. It's not impossible to get a good grade as long as you put lots of time into studying. I'm not a straight-A student, and I came out of this class with an A. Just make sure you're ready to work your butt off.",awesome

277557,"its a crazy workload (tons of busy work) with limited lab hours, some of which are a 10pm to midnight window. Many of the questions, especially on lab tests, arent clear cut in refference to the desired answer and more often than not pleading your case is futile. No one cares where you took the class so unless you are a glutant for punishment take ",poor

If you don't do these things the class will kick your  rear!!",awesome

277557,"Dr. Shively is a great teacher.  He makes things interesting and has a great sense of humor.  The only problem are his tests, which are very frustrating because he tries to trick you.  I guess that is good for weeding out the bad pre-med students, but too drastic for intro to anatomy",awesome

I ended this class with a C- which is the lowest grade I've ever received.",awful
103621,"My advice to any student looking to take Biology would be, find any other teacher in the school to take this class from. Whaley is a very smart man. However, he is not a good teacher. You will have to read & teach yourself. His tests are difficult and have strange wording. He is also very disrespectful when he tries to answer a students question.",awful
103621,"Go to class, take the pre-lecture quizzes, and do the extra credit he offers!  He even posts exam practices that are pretty much the same as his exams, so there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to be prepared for them.  This class is graded heavily on exams, so if you study and make sure you understand the concepts then you'll be fine.",good
103621,"If you're confused during a lecture don't ask him just google it or something. Because he'll just confuse you even more. There's quite a heavy work and little room for messing up (just like most classes). Exams are borderline brutal and he offers very little extra credit to fix that. You're supposed to read all 24 assigned chapters. 30 Pages each.",poor

He is unbearably bad at teaching.",awful

He can be condescending at first, but if you get passed that he really cares about his students and their quality of learning. Not many professors dedicate as much time to their students as he does. It wasn't an easy class, you have to read the textbook but at least you learn.",awesome

When students have questions, he can't answer them clearly and just says the same exact thing he said that made them confused in the first place. Don't get me wrong, he's undoubtedly a great person, he is just terrible at teaching.",awful

Very long and difficult quizzes are due before class every period. Lectures are useless and confusing. He just fills in for the bio department. Expects you to learn all from your reading. Find another",awful

He even told us he does not like this biology, but zoology",awful

His lectures can seem unclear at times but are atleast somewhat helpful on average bc he gives similar or even exact questions on quizzes/tests.

It's the amount of material that he has to cover that is a the problem for most students, they just use him as a scapegoat.

Easy for science credit, poor for learning.",poor

I had a very negative experience",awful

1307460,"Seems like he wants you to learn bio, but does not want you to do well in the class. Lessons are general but tests are specific and cover things not discussed in class, they are loaded with trick questions. If you are a bio major looking for a challenge then he is great, but if you are just looking to get your 3cr GE bio credit then there is easier",average
1307460,"The workload in this class is ridiculous. You could easily spend 2 to 4 hours per day just trying to keep up with this class. The quizzes are very difficult, the exams are even worse. If you retake the quizzes the second set of questions is always harder than the first. I would not recommend anyone taking this class from him. I should have looked.",awful
1307460,"The quizzes and tests are NOT based on lectures or reading... The only helpful information I found for this class was Quizlet... study for the exams using Quizlet and you will score will... if you actually do the work expect to be befuddled on the exams...",awful
1307460,"I took this course online after earning a C+ years ago on the main campus. I ended up with a letter grade lower the second time around. The course online is doable if you will set aside time to study. It's easy to do the assignments but the tests are more difficult. If you aren't a good test taker this class isn't for you,the final exam is tough!",average
1307460,"This was my chance to retake biology (I passed several years ago with a C) I thought this would be an easy shot since I am in my third year and know my stuff. Not so!! The material was way harder than necessary and I didn't learn a thing. Doesn't let you go back to check answers on quiz and everything is on websites and 2 hr long videos on Darwin.",awful
1307460,"Not book based teaching.  All things expected to learn are from websites.  ",awful
1307460,"Really great teacher. I don't understand all the negative ratings. Every time I had a question he would stay after with me to help me understand it. If you go, take your notes, etc you should get an A, he tries to have everyone get an A. Lectures are long but he makes them fun. Really just don't be lazy. Great guy, great teacher, great class.",awesome

1307460,"The test questions tend to be trick questions; he's just trying to get people to be better test-takers and read each question through thoroughly.  I personally thought the in-class clicker quizzes were the hardest.  But it's nice, because he dropped the 5 lowest assignments, quizzes,  and the lowest test.  He's good at explaining things.",good
1307460,"AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!!!!  He treats you like you are a lesser being and expects you to pass a timed 30 minute quiz that he is weeks away from covering the material and the quiz content is hardly on his slides and the chapter readings are about 100 pages each with fine print.  So good luck trying to find the answers on your own. ",awful
1307460,"Professor Parker makes a lot of comparisons with everyday things, which can get a little confusing. I basically teach myself Biology and we have quizzes all the time about material we haven't even covered yet.  It's not a hard class, but it can be quite stressful and inconvenient.",average
1307460,"He's a good teacher and explains things well. He tries to be funny (usually isn't), but at least tries to make the class relatively interesting. However, I wouldn't recommend taking the class because he tests you on material he hasn't taught yet. His lessons are about 2 weeks behind the tests and quizzes so you're required to teach yourself. ",average
1307460,"I'm not going to lie, this is a hard class. You have to know A LOT! But Professor Parker is a good teacher. He's really funny and is extremely nice and helpful when you have a question. You won't need a textbook other than for the LearnSmart assignments he makes you do. All of his tests are based off of his PowerPoints and old exams, so take notes!",average
1307460,"Professor Parker is terrible. I was seriously confused the whole semester and when you ask questions he makes you feel really stupid. I would not recommend Professor Parker to ANYONE.  Tests are really hard and when you ask what chapters in the text book that are being covered he says all of them. ",awful
1307460,"Dr. Parker is great teacher. He's a little odd but gives interesting and relevant metaphors to help you with concepts. Lecture based--I did not even buy a textbook. Grades are 100% quizzes and tests, which I actually liked. Take notes and you'll do well. The many negative ratings surprised me; I would definitely recommend him.",good
1307460,"This class was not at all as bad as everyone said it was. Dr. Parker is actually a really good instructor; I learned really well from him.

Don't fear all the negative comments on here, I really liked Dr. Parker!",good
1307460,"I didn't realize until now that I ended up getting a B+ in the class & I have NO idea how that happened because I only passed one test the entire semester. He walks and sweats and rambles the entire class. He reminds me of Kevin from the office: boring. He just lectures and only has exams so you need to study EVERYTHING in class. Do not reccommend.",awful
1307460,"This class was not easy. If you follow the course objectives and use the old practice exams (extensively), you'll pull off a good grade. It was a lot to take in, especially for someone who isn't majoring in science whatsoever.",average
1307460,"I thoroughly enjoyed this class. Dr. Parker is tough, but that's what helped me learn the material. He goes over everything really well and he spends plenty of time answering questions. He now records his lectures, provides you with all of his slides, and gives you some great materials for studying for his exams. He's loads better than people say",good
1307460,"Worst teacher ever! I have now taken this class twice and have passed both times, but not with a very good grade. Your grade is weighted by exams and quizzes, which are nearly impossible to understand. A friend of mine taking biology at BYU looked at one of my quizzes and said that it was harder than the test she had recently taken that day.",awful
1307460,"By far the worst teacher I have ever came across. Went to him several times and ask for help because I was struggling and he simply told me to 'Do better.' Test you on things you haven't covered yet, ramble on about nothing, no homework to help your grade, and no matter how hard you study the material, it's always different on the test. Horrible.",awful
1307460,"Doesn't respond to e-mails, rambles about nothing useful during class, doesn't follow chapter outline of textbook, grade is based solely on exams and a few quizzes - no homework to cushion grade or help with understanding of concepts. Nothing but a cause of stress. This class is the reason I no longer have a scholarship. I even had a tutor.",awful
1307460,"All you have to do is go to class and listen and you'll pass.  I got a B, if I studied or did the quizzes I would've been in the A range.  Tests are there to make you think and understand the concept not make sure you can memorize.  Use the practice tests and you'll score well on the test.",good

1307460,"HOrrible teacher to communicate with. Sent emails, canvas messages and no response ever!! How is a student suppose to communicate with the professor when he is ill. His lectures are hard and and test format is confusing. Only thing good about his class is that he records his lectures.",poor
1307460,"Professor Parker is SUPER HARD but he teaches everything you need in class. He expects you to know EVERYTHING from his class. Sometimes it is confusing but go to him and he will clear it up. FOR AN A:go to class, re-listen to his lecture till you know exactly what he say and how he says it. Test are from 80%current lect 10%past lect 10% 1610 book",awesome
1307460,"horrible class. no class interaction just lectures the entire time. he goes on tangents all of the time but still expects you to know everything. his study guides aren't at all like his tests and he has a lot of work for you to do. He treats you all like you know everything already. it's nearly impossible to pass his class.",awful
1307460,"DON'T TAKE IT. Tests are tricky. There's no hw to cushion your grade. He takes your top 10 best quiz grades to replace a test grade, but even that doesn't help.  I had another Biology professor tutor me and she said the material he taught should be in advanced bio classes and he didn't make sense of his questions. Avoid him.",awful
1307460,"Dr. Parker seems as though he wants you to learn but his test questions can be difficult. Don't miss class and when you study for the tests, stress the details covered in class and on the powerpoints. Your grade will seem to be low because of your test scores but if you do well on the quizzes, your grade will be better than expected. Good luck.",poor
1307460,"He says everything that we're tested on is in his powerpoints. A lot of the time, things are not in the powerpoints or they're in powerpoints that we haven't even covered yet. So things that haven't been introduced in class (or the powerpoints he's gone over) are on the tests. He gets annoyed if you ask questions in email, or doesn't answer email",poor
1307460,"The worst biology teacher I have ever had. He's rude to students questions in class. Tests are extremely hard, and questions are very poorly written. Quizes are hard but if you work in groups you'll be okay. Is a horrible teacher. This class could be really cool, but because you spend the entire semester trying to figure out what he wants its not.",poor
1307460,"The worse professor at UVU. He should not teach. He doesn't care about students nor your learning. He is lazy and will not answer your questions. Studying will not help and listening to lectures won't do much either. He has tenure but needs to replaced fast. There needs to be another option for cell bio at UVU. Unfortunately will not learn much.",poor
1307460,"He is very vague, and then his tests are super hard. I have taken biology twice, including a college prep biology class in high school and still have no idea what is going on during the tests. Questions are worded weird and when he is asked questions about stuff in class he tells stupid stories instead of answering it coherently. AVOID THIS CLASS!",awful
1307460,"He is an average lecturer. He is pretty clear most of the time. Although most of what he tests on is taught in class he seems to stress things differently than the book. Some things he stresses are not even in the book. This class was difficult for me for this reason. Also, fill in the blank quizzes are vague and it is difficult to guess his answer",poor
1307460,"Horrible teacher, do not take him if at all possible. Choose another professor other than Parker. He makes his class and quizes easy and then when you think that you are catching on and you know your stuff, his tests come along and wipe you out and ruin any chance of a good grade. Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!!!!",awful

He has a quiz every weekend that covers materials which are worded strngly and covers materials he has not talked about. He is a cool funny guy but his test is a little hard.",average
1307460,"His test is based on what he talks about in class. He posts old tests, and his power points he goes over in class all on blackboard.

1307460,"I would recommend not getting the book, his tests are on the things he talks about in class.  He dumbs down his lectures so you feel like you have a grip on the material but he doesn't dumb down the tests.  He goes into way more detail than necessary. With teachers like him it's no surprise that Biol 1010 is the most failed course at UVU.",average

It's easy to feel like you know what's going on in lectures but when it comes time for a test, quiz or anything else you are going to be graded on it's another story. Asking questions is futile.

I liked him as a teacher but biology is just a hard class.",poor

158088,"I don't know what the &quot;cooling off&quot; thing is, but the lectures are hilarious--going to class is like going to a comedy club. Besides, how hard can the lectures be&#63;--they are multiple choice right out of the book.",awesome
158088,"This guy should not be teaching. My advice to all of you: don't go along with that one week cooloing off period policy. We all deserve to be heard by our professors ANYTIME we have a problem. That's what we pay them for.",awful

158088,"The class is hard but the prof. is good at explaining things and the exams are very straightforward. He gives you the old exams so if you study, getting a good grade isn't hard--if you work on it. The notes are also available online so you son't have to t",awesome

158088,"this guy is one of the biggest idiots alive. he mumbles about a lot of crap as he goes on and expects u to know everything. you ask him a question its like cursing at him he gets ticked off. he is HARD! he curves the class just so people pass, a monster.",awful
158088,"He is the worst professor I have ever had. Refuses to help anyone. Luckily for the curve, the class is passable but other than that, this guy is an idiot!",awful
158088,"refuses to teach. Answer is reight word for word, but he marks wrong because graph is off. On his slide he has &quot;Standard one week cooling off period after the test&quot; before he will talk to you.",awful
158088,"He's really funny, but the team-teaching/part online setup was very bad.",good
158088,"STAY AWAY. nothing he says makes sense! talks more about vegas and bikes then econ. lectures suck- all on powerpoint with him reading it line by line. you should skip econ for a semester if he's your last choice. Aplia homework take tooo long!!!",awful
158088,"econ 310 and 311 have the worse passing rates, people like NG, are the reason why.  even though class is curved.  HE MAKES IT SO HARD.  i wouldn't recommend.",awful
158088,"Tests are WAY TOO LONG in a short amount of time.. No calculators for simple calculations which really slow you down.  Says &quot;Ok&quot; After Everyother Word which can be REALLY annoying to have to listen to.. Wouldnt Really Recommend Him.. He is nice",poor

158088,"Real difficult. His lectures have nothing to do with his lame, unnecessary difficult tests. If it wasn't for his big curve 80% of the class would have failed. 47 out of 100 was a B for me. Think about it and stay away from this horrible guy.",poor
158088,"One of the best professor's one can hope for.  Not easy, but if you don't miss his classes and pay close attention to his lectures you'll do fine. You learn a lot.His lectures are very interesting unlike many other professors' who put me to sleep.",awesome
158088,"If you are receiving your PHD in economics, then you might have a chance of getting a C in this class. His evil laugh reminds you of the wicked witch, except in this case you replace the W with a B. And just remember, NO CHANCE, thats what you've got!",awful
