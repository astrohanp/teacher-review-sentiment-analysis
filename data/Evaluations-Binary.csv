Review,1He was boring and ruined psychology for me. Nothing he ever said was clear and I would not recommend him if you want to pursue in psych. He's an easy grader but the pop quizzes everyday definitely made it hard to have a good quiz grade.,0"extremely difficult course. I thought I was going to have to retake it (like many others have to.) The labs are insanely hard and quite time consuming, and the pop quizzes are challenging. I think the tests should have easier questions but be longer. If you miss 2 multiple choice, you drop a letter grade. this course is VERY TIME CONSUMING",1Hard to understand at times. Tests are ok. Not too forgiving with grades.,1SO glad to be the hell out of this class,0"great teacher and very smart , the class is very hard and 1.",1Do not take her. She really is not interesting and is not a respectful individual. She treats her students like children. Take someone else. Very mean.,0"Awesome teacher. He's one of the few teachers whose lectures I can actually pay attention to. I'll go into the class dog tired but come out completely energized. Very funny, knowledgeable guy.",0"very good teacher loved the stories, i think he is one of the best on campus",1"I thought his class was extremely hard but despite it all, I became a confident writer. People on here say 'you can only get a c on a paper' WRONG. I got an A and a B. You just have to be in it to win it. If you want to get an A, get a different teacher. If you want learn, Go for Rand. He made Eng. 110 worth something.",1"I feel like people over-react about this class sometimes. Sure, his tests are not easy and he really expects you to know the content, but people shouldn't expect hand-holding at this stage in the game. People complain about arrogance but he was always very respectful when I went to talk to him. Class really separates the men from the boys.",1"This class was in the top two courses I've taken as a grad student at FIT. This course was challenging and extremely interesting. The discussion format of the course with his enthusiasm about swarm intelligence combined to create a fun and thought-provoking classroom atmosphere. The presentation and paper critiques were invaluable.One of the toughest classes out there, but he is one of the best teachers for it. Great guy, always willing to explain if somebody doesnt get it in the class. Is interested in the future of students; always asking for feedback. Very very tough grader, but one of the better CS majors.",1"I find everything okay except the grading on tests. I am okay with labs; it doesn't take me long to understand the concepts and to apply them. On tests, if you miss 2 multiple-choice questions, you drop a letter grade!!! It's terrible.",1Best calc teacher I could ask for. She is very clear about the expectations for quizzes/tests and teaches with examples that usually cover everything we are tested on. The lab sheets often have questions that are similar to the ones on the quizzes. Expect weekly homework on web assign and 3 group projects (easy). GSA was great too.,1"the class is very important and you will use every thing you will learn in you career however, if you can find a different teacher i advise you too because he makes the class very heavy on the student. most students fail the first time. Good luck",1"She is the best I ever had. She ginuinly cares about us, she want to know about our persinal life. She is always wiling to meet in her office. We even have her cell phone number. Strict, but fair. Ps:: she looks sexy in Facebook pictures",0"She is my best teacher in this university. She speaks clearly, she gives such good examples, I can understand what she is talking about. I think she makes the boring class very fun and the time goes fast in her class. She really knows her topic and so she is passionate about it. She is strict with attendence and turning paper in time, but if yo",1"She spends about five minutes on the lecture, and the rest of the time on applying whatever it is that we've learned, which is just how I like it. She's great about answering questions and clarifying anything you don't understand!",1"He's an interesting teacher when he lectures but much (most) of the course is done by student presentations. The problem is if a student presentation is missing information and he forgets to cover it, you may not clearly get the information you need for the test. He's also very unorganized. He doesn't seem to have a plan when he gets to class, he just wings it. Getting an ""A"" in the course was a challenge- but 1sible! He would be a great professor if he would just get organized.",1"He is brilliant in his field, but expects his students to perform at high levels, with unrealistic expectations. Only by a miracle did I get an A, and that was after a heavy curve. He does care about his students though, as he gives lots of time in class for work, while he goes around giving tips and answering questions.",1"Best mathematics professor I have ever had. Always keeps class entertaining, and she makes the material really easy to understand. Great in class examples. Go to lab and do the practice tests and there is no reason you should not get an A.",1"Good teacher with tough tests. Quizzes aren't too bad. She seems cruel at first, but after a few weeks she warms up to the class and tries to teach everybody the best she can. However, she isnt too good with outside the box, as in different random ways of doing things that aren't quite conventional.",0"Every bad thing you see here is true. He is as confused about basic astronomy as I am about how he is a professor at all. The best I can say is that he isn't an intentionally mean or rude person, but I can't say that he's nice because he's so annoying to be around. You'll do better in his course if you don't show up at all to lectures.",0"Being an engineer, classes like psych are hard for me, but I got an A in her class because she was very helpful, and rewards the amount of effort you put in. Fully recommended: participate in class, put the effort in, show her you're trying and you will score an A. Her being VERY CUTE makes the class so much more enjoyable as well ;)",0"she is very passionate about the subject which is a bonus bc she taught it well.exams straight from textbook. shes not that bad, she does have a little attitude sometimes but not a reason not to take her. she doesnt give much of direction or instructions which was the only thing i didnt like bc i wasnt sure what exactly she wanted",1"She is a great teacher, especially for C++! She teaches by lecture and example. She will teach about the basic concepts for the day by slide then she will show us some basic coding to get us to understand the concepts then we will dive into writing programs immediately!",1"If Sheldon Cooper also taught this class, I would have chosen Sheldon Cooper over this professor.",0This class is a shock to a lot of students because you actually need to study. If you study properly and don't procrastinate on the assignments you will be fine. He is a busy guy but if you try you will be able to get the help you need. He gives you past exams to help you study but you will need to actually understand the material to do well.,1one of the best lecturers I have ever seen.,0He has a major in philosophy which is why all the papers you have to write are based on philosophy. As long as your paper agrees with what he thinks you will get a good grade. Otherwise the class is boring and he talks for an hour about nonsense but it is mandatory to attend otherwise your grade will drop.,0"Best calc/mth teacher at FIT. Engages your mind & comedy is part of her specialty. Drops 3 quizzes at end of semester (shh, I wasn't sup1ed to tell). Favorite saying: ""If you factor a variable out of an integral, I deny you were in my calc class (or I cross ur name off Dr. Knoll's known student list.) Take her. Teaching is her calling and gift.",1She is an interesting person .. you can see her as a friend more than a doctor lolz,0"Terrible at teaching, actually, she doesn't teach. She expects you to just understand the material without any instruction. Terrible.",0Wouldn't surprise me if this guy turned out to be a fraud who's good at memorizing definitions from the book. I'd wager that his tests don't change that much from year to year because he doesn't understand the material well enough to make new tests. His GSA's are outstanding!,0"Hard final, useless professor. Prints out the textbook outlines and copies it onto the projector in class, making lecture useless. College classes in general are self study, but for this class you are on your own. Good luck.",0"the best comp. sci. teacher we have. he's really hard, but his teaching style forces you to learn. he makes you work for your grade such that each aspect ensures that you KNOW the material. better schools like berkeley and mit have teachers similar to him! so feel lucky to take a class with him!",1"I love her to death! She is the nicest person in the chem department. She really will die trying to help you if you come to her office, and it usually makes all the difference. Lecture may lose you, but def go to her office for help. Tests/quizes not that hard, and her grading is super generous on quizes. Really wants to see you succede.",1"He doesn't teach at all, takes him 30 mins to go over one question. It is so boring that you will fall asleep. Takes him forever to explain. He makes unfunny jokes. Good part is you will get a easy B or A, I got 60's for all his test, and I still got a A. Just come to class. and sleep. LOL",0"Fantastic, friendly, fair, funny, fascinating, flawless, fastidious, fervent,forgiving, festive & foxy. As Dr. says: ""thesaurus dot com should be your best friend.""",0"She is nice, and the class is really easy.",1"She likes long writings, if you try to be short and clear you would probably get low grade. Give her exact answer that she wants if your answer has the same meaning as hers but phrased differently she won't accept it. She does not accept the fact the people have different opinions, if you in her class you should think like her, strict on grades.",1Very difficult material. He tries to help make it clearer but he moves too fast. If you ask a question he makes you feel stupid. It is a required course and he is the only one teaching it so GOOD LUCK!!,1This is worst class I ever took. She's a hard grader and she is very rude when it comes to trying to talk to students about grades. She hurt my GPA & I had to take an extra class in order to get my GPA higher. Please avoid this class.,1"This is probably one of the best professors I have had. If you do not understand something, reach out to her as she will take the time to help you. It was because of this I was able to pass her class as at first I did not understand the material.",1"He was a good guy, really... he was. But I felt he had an alter-ego when he left to go home and grade. His expectations and how he picked apart his students papers was simply not fair. Again, great guy but avoid this class with him!!!",1She is not nice no matter what people are saying. I love math and i hated the way she was teaching it. I think she is fake with student and has a tendency to like only good students and not the one who struggle.,0"Excellent professor! I was very pleased to be in his class this semester, as he has a breadth of knowledge outside the classroom. His grading style is tough, but it works well, I believe.",1"Not all professors at FIT are great at teaching, they are brilliant but can't teach. She knows her content AND how to teach exceptionally well as a college professor.",1This class has been a waste of time. She spends most of the time just talking about what we're going to learn. And then just lectures on about random current events. She doesn't set a clear objective for class each day. Pointless syllabus. I've learned almost nothing from her class and frankly I'm not sure she knows what she's doing as a professor.,0"She's a great teacher! She seems a little nuts, but that's what makes her teaching awesome and funny!",0Labs are unnecessarily hard and annoying. Tests are very tricky.,1"What a joke, class average for the exams was less than 50, and more than half the class dropped. She should be ashamed of herself.",0"Great professor, teaches all the content really well. She has never missed a class but will be late because she is spending so much time meeting students to help them out. Really smart and nice, just don't forget to call her Dr. Pay attention and do the homework and you'll do really well.",1"He knows what he is teaching and he know what others thinking, you got a question ir your mind and he will gonna give you the answer even before u ask&#63; very tough in grading, everyone should take a course with him atleast once.",1I took her for Developmental Math since my last Algebra class was more than 40 years ago. She is very willing to sit with you and explain problems and is genuinely wanting you to succeed. Managed with her help to take all 3 sections in one semester and get it done!,1"Any professor that throws markers in frustration is a good professor. ^_^ All in all, my favorite math professor.",0Shares applicable stories in class to relate to material. . .entertaining!!,1"The professor is AMAZING. The class structure is AWFUL. If there was no lab portion for this class, everybody would get an easy A. BUT, the lab portion is the hardest part of this class. Some lab sections are led by ""instructors"" who don't know how to do anything. Lecture exams are based only on her slides and notes which is great because no book",1Made the class very interesting. Loved his stories!,1"That said, she was awful. Students would correct her all the time on simple problems, and she often couldn't answer things where there was legitimate confusion. She once wore her sweater backwards and inside-out and never noticed. She also ended class abruptly once after realizing she had written all over the white board with permanent marker.",0I learned a lot this semester. Don't purchase the book as it is not used. He is a very harsh grader. The labs are very difficult. His tests SUCK. I attended all classes and failed all of his tests. He killed all of my career goals as a Computer Science professor. This class makes me want to kill myself!,0His lectures inspire you to learn about the subject. The course is not very easy but is an essential for any CS student. Dr. is always willing to help you and explains the concepts in a clear way.,1"Dr. is excellent. Her lectures go very fast you need to be focused. It is easy to let your grade slip, but as long as effort is put into the class it's fine. She is very passionate and has lots of energy.",1"In a nutshell, this professor looks for every excuse to give students a bad grade. Even if you give him high-quality work, he will never have anything good to say about it and will always complain about even the smallest imperfections; a single small imperfections in your work could totally undermine a good grade.",1"This is the worst professor that I have ever had. I ultimately ended up failing the course and I have never received lower than a B- for a lower grade. When I went into her office hours to address my grade, she wouldn't talk about past assignments and when asked if I could speak she said, ""no, because you are wrong."" Avoid this class!",1I do not recommend her. She is hugely disorganized - all of the readings are on BB so I spent a fortune printing and the syllabus did not match the readings. The first half of the semester she spent telling the same 3 stories. Her assignments are stupid & the midterm was much too hard for this class. She only wants to hear what she believes.,0"This professor is arrogant and does not care about his students. In fact, he seems to take pleasure failing students. Whenever he finds out you don't know something (like if you were to ask him a question), he will berate you for that. While he expects students to finish an exam in one hour, he stalls on grading the exams gives a lot of excuses.",1"DO NOT TAKE HER! the class is ridiculously hard, the reading is equivalent to like 10 books and she just rambles on and on about how great Africa is. Uses all kind of propoganda to back her stuff up and she hates that shes white.",0"Professor is a very kind lady. If you goto her office hours she really tries to help you understand the material. She's not the most organized, always running late, but she gives alot of oppurtunities to boost up your grade. If you need an extension she will give it to you. Goto office hours, study hard you'll do well. She grades fair.",1"very good prof. class contains lots of reading. you dont have to do them all, but you must pay attention to what she saya. the midterm is fear, and the final is a take-home. she is extreamly nice...also, be very openminded in the class, and get ready to decunstruct all you've learned about africa.",1"She's a real sweetheart. Attendance counts for this class, so at least make sure you show up. Her lectures are easy to follow and she covers everything needed for the homework or exams. She always makes it a point to tell you what types of problems you should focus on for the exams. Best teacher for a freshman Chem class.",1"I think all of the nice comments were written by himself. &quot;Always willing to help&quot;, give me a break! Unfortunately he's the only one teaching this class.",1"Gotta take this course. Even if you fail, you will end up doing yourself world of good. Whatever the heck be your major or reason to take the course, you get a chance, take it and put some effort, otherwise you will regret it for your entire life.",1Simply amazing. She is very clear and likes to make things simpler rather than more complicated. Funny as well! If you study and do your homework you'll be more than fine!,1"This professor is all over the place when teaching and can be difficult to keep up with. However, what I really enjoyed was his passion and knowledge on Puerto Rican studies. His assigned readings will help organize his lectures. There were two exams, the final was a 3-5 page paper and that was pretty much it.",1"Prof. has a big course load. She does not make room for the students responsibilities outside of class. The books that she makes students buy are too expensive. She expects a lot from students but she doesn't deliver herself. Unfair, unjust and unreasonable. Her knowledge of social injustices are just that. She is smart but not wise. Avoid.",0"Too much pride and arrogance. He thinks that just because he has a phD, he has the right to rub it in our faces that he is more knowledgeable than we are in Computer Science and arrogantly berate those who don't know what he knows. We don't need a professor who shoves it up our faces that he knows more than we do, we just need a prof who teaches.",1"Yes, this class is time consuming. In my opinion, the lecture exams were easy as hell. You don't really need the textbook, because the prof puts all her notes and lectures slides up before lectures. Exams are based only from her notes (Not textbook). The Lab Portion, was easy as well. I had to put in alot of effort in memorizing, other than that A+",1"Best teacher in the history of like, FOREVER! Always happy and willing to help! She's here for her students and it shows! She hasn't been here 35 years for her health, you know! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",1"average teacher, very very harsh grader",1"I recently just finished taking Comp 110 with him and it was the hardest class of my freshman semester. He takes it way too serious for a 100 level class. 80% of the class is papers so you would think you control the grade you get, right? Wrong.  He will tear apart your paper and give you a bad grade despite your efforts. I worked hard for a C.",1"decent teacher, expect to work a lot, and don't expect a good grade.",1"Hardest and Best teacher ever. If you get an A in his class you are destined for greatness. Most helpfull and approachable teacher in the Computer Science department. If you are lazy and not smart, don't take a course with him.",1Cool!,0Professor is an amazing person but not a professor who can teach you the physics that you need for the rest of your life. Its hard to understand her. exams and quizzes are not bad.. Just do homework and stay on top of the material on your own and you will get that A!,1Terrible teacher and doesn't care to help his students in any way.,1I absolutely love her. She makes math easy. Pretty funny and good for help outside of class.,1"He teaches a tough class, but graciously curves as well. Tests are very hard, the labs aren't too bad. The semester long team project makes your grade for the most part. He is a fun teacher but loves playing devil's advocate in class discussions.",1"This was a pretty boring class in my opinion. You don't really need the textbook, it was a waste of money. Just take notes on the power point slides and study the online quizzes .",0"Multiple choice questions are infuriating at times, there will be ones with more than one answer and ones where all answers are wrong. The part about them that was the most annoying is that for example if there are three correct choices and you miss one you miss the question and get minus points. That aside he is a very good friendly teacher.",1Life Changing,0"Nice teacher. Looks scary at first, but cares about your grade. Not entirely clear and sometimes doesn't explain things too well. Tests were difficult, but not im1sible.",0"Simply amazing. The classes are more like a group discussion than a lecture. Each student had to do give a presentation about a specific topic and write a paper by the end of the semester. We discussed the subject, ideas, helped each other and learned. We read a lot. There's a list of papers for each class. It definitely worth it. It's a great area",1"Class consists of 5 writing assignments, in class midterm(short answers)and take home final. The assignments are easy if you actually do the readings and listen in class. Otherwise you'll find yourself stressing, looking over the thousands of readings on blackboard looking for the answers. She is really nice and understanding in person.",1Lectures are long,1"Her lectures are boring but attendance is mandatory. Videos shown in class will appear on tests. There are 4 exams, the final one cumulative and optional. She offers a lot of extra credit that will boost your grade. Read the book, study her slides, take occasional notes and you should do fine. The subject itself is interesting.",1"Hum...He knows his stuff, but unless you already know yours, you aren't likely to learn much.",1"I found it very hard to succeed in this class. You have access to past exams, but they're unanswered. It's difficult to study because you never know if your answer is correct, even with the internet. The labs are generally time consuming and of medium-hard difficulty, but you basically must get an A in the labs to get a C in the class.",1"Plays around way too much in class, takes more time trying to be ""relatable"" than actually teaching anything.",0"He is the one of the best professors i've had so far at FIT. His exams are tricky (not hard) and his grading is very strict, but that's because he really wants you to learn the material. I think everyone that is complaining about his class wants to get a good grade, without actually earning it.",1He is such a great guy. He is very young and therefore will act as one of us. He blends extremely well with the class and prepares you both for the material as well as for the real life applications. Great way to start your Aviation Career!,1He's pretty cool,0An Interesting Class,0Best teacher ever! She takes time to explain everything clearly. She REALLY cares about all the students. She wants us to be successful. She always smile. She is always available. Answers e-mail quickly. She understands how difficult it is for foreign students. We need more teachers like her.,1"Psychology is an interesting topic i believe if you really want to learn more about it, than its good to ask questions after class. if you're there just to pass, i recommend to study the problem sets and beware of those quizzes. his quizzes are pretty tough but he gives the students tons of opportunities like writing assignment, studyQs. HES GREAT!",1"Awesome prof.! Great guy in general... always there for help. He also understands how pilots dont like showing that they dont know something, so he always offers private help. Fun to work with.",1The GSA in this class does a lot more work than this professor. We're better off if the GSA taught the class instead.,1GSA taught most of the classes. The professor is department head. Had another professor offer to teach the class how ever the professor is too selfish and would not allow it. Not much on test is taught in the class.,1Explains concepts well,1"He is one of the best teachers I have ever had. His class is very difficult, but you will learn so much.",1"Although Prof may be all over the place during lectures, she truly does care about her students. Make use of her office hours for sure because she is always open to explaining things that may have been unclear during lecture. She really wants her students to succeed so do not hesitate in asking her for help.",1"One Of those Professors who cant speak english , nor has any interest towards teaching, but feels great for some reason .",0"Failing the class, mainly due to the super-tough exams.",1I am taking her class next semester. Very good at getting across what we needto know. hard class but great!,1"She wants you to do well in the class. She is very helpful and will set up study sessions. Make sure to pay attention in class and study for the tests. She is easy to understand and she acknowledges that teaching off slides is not her favorite way of teaching, but she must. Very cute teacher.",0"Very easy A+! He is a really sweet old guy, as long as you sit in the right spot and don't break his focus! If you like absolutely no work and can take lots of anectdotal stories about his life and past patients, this is the class for you.",1"She is awesome, if you study and attend lecture you'll be fine. Don't buy the text book.",1Loved his stories and films.  Fun class.  Learned lots.,1the best teacher in the world.,0he may give the exam prior to actual test but half of the answers are not found in the textbook so whats the point...when each q is worth 3 points you can only make a minimum of 3 mistakes or forget the A or good grade in the class,1"Multiple choice questions are infuriating at times, there will be ones with more than one answer and ones where all answers are wrong. The part about them that was the most annoying is that for example if there are three correct choices and you miss one you miss the question and get minus points. That aside he is a very good friendly teacher.",1"Data Structures has been the hardest course I have taken to date. Requires you to do several hours of studying a night. If you don't show up for class or text/mess around during class expect to fail. On the flip side, he inspires the students to learn more about the topic. Even though I was struggling, I always enjoyed going to class to learn.",1"His quizes are hard, labs are challenging, but you learn alot and its a very worthwhile class.",1"He is a great astronomy professor and superb lecturer. Most of his content comes from lectures, but he makes it interesting. His tests aren't too difficult if you take good notes. Be careful of your TA, if you end up with a bad one, you will have to do extra to get a good grade.",1"Worse teacher I've had in my life. The material is relevant, but very hard due to his method of teaching. The exams are the main killer. Unless you are willing to focus all of your effort toward his class, expect a C. He killed my dreams and hopes.",0"She is the best math teacher I have ever had. She is funny, energetic, and goes out of her way to help you. I had her for both undergrad and grad level math! She rocks!",1Believes in a lot of group work in class. Pretty easy class overall though. Can revise essays for a better grade even after the due date. If you put in the work she will give you an A.,1"She is a fun teacher, and will try forever to help you understand the material. She wants to see you succeed, and will die trying. :)",1"Her class was easy, but she is the most unorganized person ever. She makes a lot of mistakes and is not always on time.",1"He's a great teacher. You just have to go home and independently studying to thoroughly understand everything. Tests are challenging, but he just wants to make sure you absolutely understand everything. No doubt, you'll learn and be challenged. If you do poorly, you're not trying hard enough. And if you need help, just ask.",1Cool professor. Strict but fun.,1Dr. is extremely helpful with clarification of portions of the subject that are not understood. She will even take the time to review your assignment before you submit it for grading.,1"I really enjoyed this class. It really separates serious students from the slackers. If you actually study, don't procrastinate, and seek help when you need it there is no reason you should fail this class, yet many people do. It is one of the most important CS classes you ever take and you need to treat it that way.",1"Tough teacher. Group projects are a thing now; do not procrastinate. The homework is online and there is at least one section due every week. Quiz every week. Not too many tests. Tests are tough but tend to be based off of the homework, quizzes, and labs.",1Great teacher all around!,0Favorite professor.,0No extra credit. Quiz every week. Unless you have taken this course before I advice to take another teacher or you will have to study a lot.,1"I love my professor. Her class is never boring. She uses the textbook, but always has Power Point or PDF's to help the understanding. What I like best, is she always relates everything to real life, so it makes it easy to understand and it makes sense. Also, she always give tricks on how to learn things, so they stay in your head forever.",1"Class is definitely difficult, but a very important one at that! Menezes knows his stuff, he doesn't always explain it THAT great, but he is a good teacher. Just don't expect any easy grade at all.",1"I just love her, her lectures are always on point and she explains everything you need to know for the tests.",1"Multiple choice questions are infuriating at times, there will be ones with more than one answer and ones where all answers are wrong. The part about them that was the most annoying is that for example if there are three correct choices and you miss one you miss the question and get minus points. That aside he is a very good friendly teacher.",1shes an okay professor. Her tests are tricky and youll really need to read the textbook. i didnt really attend classes cause its all from the book. she gives tons of extra credit. I got an A. it was too easy for me,1"He really knows his stuff, and is an effective instructor. However, he often shows an irritability with his students which undermines his frequent requests that students visit his office hours. In a few infrequent cases, he's tested on vocabulary that was not explicitly covered in class.",1"SHE TRIES TO BE FUNNY. In general, the class is easy but only if you do all the homework, quizzes and labs! everything! because there is a lot to cover in just one hour so you have to be on top of it. she is clear and fair. very helpful too! IN my opinion, her class goes with a good rhythm not too fast or too slow",0"Dr. is overall a very good teacher. Just show up to the lectures, she explains everything in a very clear fashion. The homework is once a week and not very hard. Would definitely reccomend.",1"Fair grader and tough tests, but very informative and helpful. Labs are easier and provide a well needed grade boost in the class.",1"Tests are fair, but very difficult. I got below a 50 on every pop quiz and the three tests so far I got a 40, 70, and 40. I came into this with a 3.7 but this is something else. I've never gotten below a B in my life but I will be happy with a C here. last test had 34Fs,6 Ds,5 Cs, 2 Bs, 1 A. only 1 A test avg with a 91% for the whole year.",1Smart guy. He helps students but does not chase us. If you need help you have to go and find him in his office. You learn a lot in the class. One of the best in the department.,1"I was forced to sort of take this class being a transfer student as other classes were filling up. I was very concerned after reading reviews from this site. The thing is, she's not that bad. She gave amazing lectures, she was well informed about the topics and very eloquent. She doesn't baby you, and she expects you to be independent.",1"Dr. Knoll is a genius. She teaches in a brilliant fashion and gives excellent notes. She can be intimidating and there is a lot of material. The grade mainly consists of quizzes and tests. The course requires effort, but in my opinion Dr. is the best choice to take it with. Had for calc 1 and 2.",1"The bomb.com! Get her for PreChem and Chem, and life is a breeze!",0"I liked her lectures very much. They were very interesting and she clearly knows a lot about her topics. (As all professors are sup1ed to) BUT, in the context of her grading style, she is not very planned nor is she organized. The distribution of percentages that determine ones grade are very very poorly set up.",1"She can make something difficult appear extremely easy. I was never fund of calculus, yet she made me love it. As always, for an A you have to study, but there is no ""hunt"" for formulas whatsoever. I never opened the book. No need! She is a MUST at FIT!",1He is the easiest A. He gives you the exams three weeks in advance.,1"One of the best math teachers I have ever had. She is super helpful and clear. Any issues I had with the class were with the GSAs. Homework can be difficult because it's through WebAssign, but it's not too bad honestly. Study the quizzes, and you'll do great on the tests. She does drop some grades, but I won't say exactly what was dropped.",1"Great teacher, available to students, HARD grader. This is probably the most valuable class you'll take as a CS student.",1=======,Review,1He was boring and ruined psychology for me. Nothing he ever said was clear and I would not recommend him if you want to pursue in psych. He's an easy grader but the pop quizzes everyday definitely made it hard to have a good quiz grade.,0"extremely difficult course. I thought I was going to have to retake it (like many others have to.) The labs are insanely hard and quite time consuming, and the pop quizzes are challenging. I think the tests should have easier questions but be longer. If you miss 2 multiple choice, you drop a letter grade. this course is VERY TIME CONSUMING",1Hard to understand at times. Tests are ok. Not too forgiving with grades.,1SO glad to be the hell out of this class,0"great teacher and very smart , the class is very hard and 1.",1Do not take her. She really is not interesting and is not a respectful individual. She treats her students like children. Take someone else. Very mean.,0"Awesome teacher. He's one of the few teachers whose lectures I can actually pay attention to. I'll go into the class dog tired but come out completely energized. Very funny, knowledgeable guy.",0"very good teacher loved the stories, i think he is one of the best on campus",1"I thought his class was extremely hard but despite it all, I became a confident writer. People on here say 'you can only get a c on a paper' WRONG. I got an A and a B. You just have to be in it to win it. If you want to get an A, get a different teacher. If you want learn, Go for Rand. He made Eng. 110 worth something.",1"I feel like people over-react about this class sometimes. Sure, his tests are not easy and he really expects you to know the content, but people shouldn't expect hand-holding at this stage in the game. People complain about arrogance but he was always very respectful when I went to talk to him. Class really separates the men from the boys.",1"This class was in the top two courses I've taken as a grad student at FIT. This course was challenging and extremely interesting. The discussion format of the course with his enthusiasm about swarm intelligence combined to create a fun and thought-provoking classroom atmosphere. The presentation and paper critiques were invaluable.One of the toughest classes out there, but he is one of the best teachers for it. Great guy, always willing to explain if somebody doesnt get it in the class. Is interested in the future of students; always asking for feedback. Very very tough grader, but one of the better CS majors.",1"I find everything okay except the grading on tests. I am okay with labs; it doesn't take me long to understand the concepts and to apply them. On tests, if you miss 2 multiple-choice questions, you drop a letter grade!!! It's terrible.",1Best calc teacher I could ask for. She is very clear about the expectations for quizzes/tests and teaches with examples that usually cover everything we are tested on. The lab sheets often have questions that are similar to the ones on the quizzes. Expect weekly homework on web assign and 3 group projects (easy). GSA was great too.,1"the class is very important and you will use every thing you will learn in you career however, if you can find a different teacher i advise you too because he makes the class very heavy on the student. most students fail the first time. Good luck",1"She is the best I ever had. She ginuinly cares about us, she want to know about our persinal life. She is always wiling to meet in her office. We even have her cell phone number. Strict, but fair. Ps:: she looks sexy in Facebook pictures",0"She is my best teacher in this university. She speaks clearly, she gives such good examples, I can understand what she is talking about. I think she makes the boring class very fun and the time goes fast in her class. She really knows her topic and so she is passionate about it. She is strict with attendence and turning paper in time, but if yo",1"She spends about five minutes on the lecture, and the rest of the time on applying whatever it is that we've learned, which is just how I like it. She's great about answering questions and clarifying anything you don't understand!",1"He's an interesting teacher when he lectures but much (most) of the course is done by student presentations. The problem is if a student presentation is missing information and he forgets to cover it, you may not clearly get the information you need for the test. He's also very unorganized. He doesn't seem to have a plan when he gets to class, he just wings it. Getting an ""A"" in the course was a challenge- but possible! He would be a great professor if he would just get organized.",1"He is brilliant in his field, but expects his students to perform at high levels, with unrealistic expectations. Only by a miracle did I get an A, and that was after a heavy curve. He does care about his students though, as he gives lots of time in class for work, while he goes around giving tips and answering questions.",1"Best mathematics professor I have ever had. Always keeps class entertaining, and she makes the material really easy to understand. Great in class examples. Go to lab and do the practice tests and there is no reason you should not get an A.",1"Good teacher with tough tests. Quizzes aren't too bad. She seems cruel at first, but after a few weeks she warms up to the class and tries to teach everybody the best she can. However, she isnt too good with outside the box, as in different random ways of doing things that aren't quite conventional.",0"Every bad thing you see here is true. He is as confused about basic astronomy as I am about how he is a professor at all. The best I can say is that he isn't an intentionally mean or rude person, but I can't say that he's nice because he's so annoying to be around. You'll do better in his course if you don't show up at all to lectures.",0"Being an engineer, classes like psych are hard for me, but I got an A in her class because she was very helpful, and rewards the amount of effort you put in. Fully recommended: participate in class, put the effort in, show her you're trying and you will score an A. Her being VERY CUTE makes the class so much more enjoyable as well ;)",0"she is very passionate about the subject which is a bonus bc she taught it well.exams straight from textbook. shes not that bad, she does have a little attitude sometimes but not a reason not to take her. she doesnt give much of direction or instructions which was the only thing i didnt like bc i wasnt sure what exactly she wanted",1"She is a great teacher, especially for C++! She teaches by lecture and example. She will teach about the basic concepts for the day by slide then she will show us some basic coding to get us to understand the concepts then we will dive into writing programs immediately!",1"If Sheldon Cooper also taught this class, I would have chosen Sheldon Cooper over this professor.",0This class is a shock to a lot of students because you actually need to study. If you study properly and don't procrastinate on the assignments you will be fine. He is a busy guy but if you try you will be able to get the help you need. He gives you past exams to help you study but you will need to actually understand the material to do well.,1one of the best lecturers I have ever seen.,0He has a major in philosophy which is why all the papers you have to write are based on philosophy. As long as your paper agrees with what he thinks you will get a good grade. Otherwise the class is boring and he talks for an hour about nonsense but it is mandatory to attend otherwise your grade will drop.,0"Best calc/mth teacher at FIT. Engages your mind & comedy is part of her specialty. Drops 3 quizzes at end of semester (shh, I wasn't supposed to tell). Favorite saying: ""If you factor a variable out of an integral, I deny you were in my calc class (or I cross ur name off Dr. Knoll's known student list.) Take her. Teaching is her calling and gift.",1She is an interesting person .. you can see her as a friend more than a doctor lolz,0"Terrible at teaching, actually, she doesn't teach. She expects you to just understand the material without any instruction. Terrible.",0Wouldn't surprise me if this guy turned out to be a fraud who's good at memorizing definitions from the book. I'd wager that his tests don't change that much from year to year because he doesn't understand the material well enough to make new tests. His GSA's are outstanding!,0"Hard final, useless professor. Prints out the textbook outlines and copies it onto the projector in class, making lecture useless. College classes in general are self study, but for this class you are on your own. Good luck.",0"the best comp. sci. teacher we have. he's really hard, but his teaching style forces you to learn. he makes you work for your grade such that each aspect ensures that you KNOW the material. better schools like berkeley and mit have teachers similar to him! so feel lucky to take a class with him!",1"I love her to death! She is the nicest person in the chem department. She really will die trying to help you if you come to her office, and it usually makes all the difference. Lecture may lose you, but def go to her office for help. Tests/quizes not that hard, and her grading is super generous on quizes. Really wants to see you succede.",1"He doesn't teach at all, takes him 30 mins to go over one question. It is so boring that you will fall asleep. Takes him forever to explain. He makes unfunny jokes. Good part is you will get a easy B or A, I got 60's for all his test, and I still got a A. Just come to class. and sleep. LOL",0"Fantastic, friendly, fair, funny, fascinating, flawless, fastidious, fervent,forgiving, festive & foxy. As Dr. says: ""thesaurus dot com should be your best friend.""",0"She is nice, and the class is really easy.",1"She likes long writings, if you try to be short and clear you would probably get low grade. Give her exact answer that she wants if your answer has the same meaning as hers but phrased differently she won't accept it. She does not accept the fact the people have different opinions, if you in her class you should think like her, strict on grades.",1Very difficult material. He tries to help make it clearer but he moves too fast. If you ask a question he makes you feel stupid. It is a required course and he is the only one teaching it so GOOD LUCK!!,1This is worst class I ever took. She's a hard grader and she is very rude when it comes to trying to talk to students about grades. She hurt my GPA & I had to take an extra class in order to get my GPA higher. Please avoid this class.,1"This is probably one of the best professors I have had. If you do not understand something, reach out to her as she will take the time to help you. It was because of this I was able to pass her class as at first I did not understand the material.",1"He was a good guy, really... he was. But I felt he had an alter-ego when he left to go home and grade. His expectations and how he picked apart his students papers was simply not fair. Again, great guy but avoid this class with him!!!",1She is not nice no matter what people are saying. I love math and i hated the way she was teaching it. I think she is fake with student and has a tendency to like only good students and not the one who struggle.,0"Excellent professor! I was very pleased to be in his class this semester, as he has a breadth of knowledge outside the classroom. His grading style is tough, but it works well, I believe.",1"Not all professors at FIT are great at teaching, they are brilliant but can't teach. She knows her content AND how to teach exceptionally well as a college professor.",1This class has been a waste of time. She spends most of the time just talking about what we're going to learn. And then just lectures on about random current events. She doesn't set a clear objective for class each day. Pointless syllabus. I've learned almost nothing from her class and frankly I'm not sure she knows what she's doing as a professor.,0"She's a great teacher! She seems a little nuts, but that's what makes her teaching awesome and funny!",0Labs are unnecessarily hard and annoying. Tests are very tricky.,1"What a joke, class average for the exams was less than 50, and more than half the class dropped. She should be ashamed of herself.",0"Great professor, teaches all the content really well. She has never missed a class but will be late because she is spending so much time meeting students to help them out. Really smart and nice, just don't forget to call her Dr. Pay attention and do the homework and you'll do really well.",1"He knows what he is teaching and he know what others thinking, you got a question ir your mind and he will gonna give you the answer even before u ask&#63; very tough in grading, everyone should take a course with him atleast once.",1I took her for Developmental Math since my last Algebra class was more than 40 years ago. She is very willing to sit with you and explain problems and is genuinely wanting you to succeed. Managed with her help to take all 3 sections in one semester and get it done!,1"Any professor that throws markers in frustration is a good professor. ^_^ All in all, my favorite math professor.",0Shares applicable stories in class to relate to material. . .entertaining!!,1"The professor is AMAZING. The class structure is AWFUL. If there was no lab portion for this class, everybody would get an easy A. BUT, the lab portion is the hardest part of this class. Some lab sections are led by ""instructors"" who don't know how to do anything. Lecture exams are based only on her slides and notes which is great because no book",1Made the class very interesting. Loved his stories!,1"That said, she was awful. Students would correct her all the time on simple problems, and she often couldn't answer things where there was legitimate confusion. She once wore her sweater backwards and inside-out and never noticed. She also ended class abruptly once after realizing she had written all over the white board with permanent marker.",0I learned a lot this semester. Don't purchase the book as it is not used. He is a very harsh grader. The labs are very difficult. His tests SUCK. I attended all classes and failed all of his tests. He killed all of my career goals as a Computer Science professor. This class makes me want to kill myself!,0His lectures inspire you to learn about the subject. The course is not very easy but is an essential for any CS student. Dr. is always willing to help you and explains the concepts in a clear way.,1"Dr. is excellent. Her lectures go very fast you need to be focused. It is easy to let your grade slip, but as long as effort is put into the class it's fine. She is very passionate and has lots of energy.",1"In a nutshell, this professor looks for every excuse to give students a bad grade. Even if you give him high-quality work, he will never have anything good to say about it and will always complain about even the smallest imperfections; a single small imperfections in your work could totally undermine a good grade.",1"This is the worst professor that I have ever had. I ultimately ended up failing the course and I have never received lower than a B- for a lower grade. When I went into her office hours to address my grade, she wouldn't talk about past assignments and when asked if I could speak she said, ""no, because you are wrong."" Avoid this class!",1I do not recommend her. She is hugely disorganized - all of the readings are on BB so I spent a fortune printing and the syllabus did not match the readings. The first half of the semester she spent telling the same 3 stories. Her assignments are stupid & the midterm was much too hard for this class. She only wants to hear what she believes.,0"This professor is arrogant and does not care about his students. In fact, he seems to take pleasure failing students. Whenever he finds out you don't know something (like if you were to ask him a question), he will berate you for that. While he expects students to finish an exam in one hour, he stalls on grading the exams gives a lot of excuses.",1"DO NOT TAKE HER! the class is ridiculously hard, the reading is equivalent to like 10 books and she just rambles on and on about how great Africa is. Uses all kind of propoganda to back her stuff up and she hates that shes white.",0"Professor is a very kind lady. If you goto her office hours she really tries to help you understand the material. She's not the most organized, always running late, but she gives alot of oppurtunities to boost up your grade. If you need an extension she will give it to you. Goto office hours, study hard you'll do well. She grades fair.",1"very good prof. class contains lots of reading. you dont have to do them all, but you must pay attention to what she saya. the midterm is fear, and the final is a take-home. she is extreamly nice...also, be very openminded in the class, and get ready to decunstruct all you've learned about africa.",1"She's a real sweetheart. Attendance counts for this class, so at least make sure you show up. Her lectures are easy to follow and she covers everything needed for the homework or exams. She always makes it a point to tell you what types of problems you should focus on for the exams. Best teacher for a freshman Chem class.",1"I think all of the nice comments were written by himself. &quot;Always willing to help&quot;, give me a break! Unfortunately he's the only one teaching this class.",1"Gotta take this course. Even if you fail, you will end up doing yourself world of good. Whatever the heck be your major or reason to take the course, you get a chance, take it and put some effort, otherwise you will regret it for your entire life.",1Simply amazing. She is very clear and likes to make things simpler rather than more complicated. Funny as well! If you study and do your homework you'll be more than fine!,1"This professor is all over the place when teaching and can be difficult to keep up with. However, what I really enjoyed was his passion and knowledge on Puerto Rican studies. His assigned readings will help organize his lectures. There were two exams, the final was a 3-5 page paper and that was pretty much it.",1"Prof. has a big course load. She does not make room for the students responsibilities outside of class. The books that she makes students buy are too expensive. She expects a lot from students but she doesn't deliver herself. Unfair, unjust and unreasonable. Her knowledge of social injustices are just that. She is smart but not wise. Avoid.",0"Too much pride and arrogance. He thinks that just because he has a phD, he has the right to rub it in our faces that he is more knowledgeable than we are in Computer Science and arrogantly berate those who don't know what he knows. We don't need a professor who shoves it up our faces that he knows more than we do, we just need a prof who teaches.",1"Yes, this class is time consuming. In my opinion, the lecture exams were easy as hell. You don't really need the textbook, because the prof puts all her notes and lectures slides up before lectures. Exams are based only from her notes (Not textbook). The Lab Portion, was easy as well. I had to put in alot of effort in memorizing, other than that A+",1"Best teacher in the history of like, FOREVER! Always happy and willing to help! She's here for her students and it shows! She hasn't been here 35 years for her health, you know! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",1"average teacher, very very harsh grader",1"I recently just finished taking Comp 110 with him and it was the hardest class of my freshman semester. He takes it way too serious for a 100 level class. 80% of the class is papers so you would think you control the grade you get, right? Wrong.  He will tear apart your paper and give you a bad grade despite your efforts. I worked hard for a C.",1"decent teacher, expect to work a lot, and don't expect a good grade.",1"Hardest and Best teacher ever. If you get an A in his class you are destined for greatness. Most helpfull and approachable teacher in the Computer Science department. If you are lazy and not smart, don't take a course with him.",1Cool!,0Professor is an amazing person but not a professor who can teach you the physics that you need for the rest of your life. Its hard to understand her. exams and quizzes are not bad.. Just do homework and stay on top of the material on your own and you will get that A!,1Terrible teacher and doesn't care to help his students in any way.,1I absolutely love her. She makes math easy. Pretty funny and good for help outside of class.,1"He teaches a tough class, but graciously curves as well. Tests are very hard, the labs aren't too bad. The semester long team project makes your grade for the most part. He is a fun teacher but loves playing devil's advocate in class discussions.",1"This was a pretty boring class in my opinion. You don't really need the textbook, it was a waste of money. Just take notes on the power point slides and study the online quizzes .",0"Multiple choice questions are infuriating at times, there will be ones with more than one answer and ones where all answers are wrong. The part about them that was the most annoying is that for example if there are three correct choices and you miss one you miss the question and get minus points. That aside he is a very good friendly teacher.",1Life Changing,0"Nice teacher. Looks scary at first, but cares about your grade. Not entirely clear and sometimes doesn't explain things too well. Tests were difficult, but not impossible.",0"Simply amazing. The classes are more like a group discussion than a lecture. Each student had to do give a presentation about a specific topic and write a paper by the end of the semester. We discussed the subject, ideas, helped each other and learned. We read a lot. There's a list of papers for each class. It definitely worth it. It's a great area",1"Class consists of 5 writing assignments, in class midterm(short answers)and take home final. The assignments are easy if you actually do the readings and listen in class. Otherwise you'll find yourself stressing, looking over the thousands of readings on blackboard looking for the answers. She is really nice and understanding in person.",1Lectures are long,1"Her lectures are boring but attendance is mandatory. Videos shown in class will appear on tests. There are 4 exams, the final one cumulative and optional. She offers a lot of extra credit that will boost your grade. Read the book, study her slides, take occasional notes and you should do fine. The subject itself is interesting.",1"Hum...He knows his stuff, but unless you already know yours, you aren't likely to learn much.",1"I found it very hard to succeed in this class. You have access to past exams, but they're unanswered. It's difficult to study because you never know if your answer is correct, even with the internet. The labs are generally time consuming and of medium-hard difficulty, but you basically must get an A in the labs to get a C in the class.",1"Plays around way too much in class, takes more time trying to be ""relatable"" than actually teaching anything.",0"He is the one of the best professors i've had so far at FIT. His exams are tricky (not hard) and his grading is very strict, but that's because he really wants you to learn the material. I think everyone that is complaining about his class wants to get a good grade, without actually earning it.",1He is such a great guy. He is very young and therefore will act as one of us. He blends extremely well with the class and prepares you both for the material as well as for the real life applications. Great way to start your Aviation Career!,1He's pretty cool,0An Interesting Class,0Best teacher ever! She takes time to explain everything clearly. She REALLY cares about all the students. She wants us to be successful. She always smile. She is always available. Answers e-mail quickly. She understands how difficult it is for foreign students. We need more teachers like her.,1"Psychology is an interesting topic i believe if you really want to learn more about it, than its good to ask questions after class. if you're there just to pass, i recommend to study the problem sets and beware of those quizzes. his quizzes are pretty tough but he gives the students tons of opportunities like writing assignment, studyQs. HES GREAT!",1"Awesome prof.! Great guy in general... always there for help. He also understands how pilots dont like showing that they dont know something, so he always offers private help. Fun to work with.",1The GSA in this class does a lot more work than this professor. We're better off if the GSA taught the class instead.,1GSA taught most of the classes. The professor is department head. Had another professor offer to teach the class how ever the professor is too selfish and would not allow it. Not much on test is taught in the class.,1Explains concepts well,1"He is one of the best teachers I have ever had. His class is very difficult, but you will learn so much.",1"Although Prof may be all over the place during lectures, she truly does care about her students. Make use of her office hours for sure because she is always open to explaining things that may have been unclear during lecture. She really wants her students to succeed so do not hesitate in asking her for help.",1"One Of those Professors who cant speak english , nor has any interest towards teaching, but feels great for some reason .",0"Failing the class, mainly due to the super-tough exams.",1I am taking her class next semester. Very good at getting across what we needto know. hard class but great!,1"She wants you to do well in the class. She is very helpful and will set up study sessions. Make sure to pay attention in class and study for the tests. She is easy to understand and she acknowledges that teaching off slides is not her favorite way of teaching, but she must. Very cute teacher.",0"Very easy A+! He is a really sweet old guy, as long as you sit in the right spot and don't break his focus! If you like absolutely no work and can take lots of anectdotal stories about his life and past patients, this is the class for you.",1"She is awesome, if you study and attend lecture you'll be fine. Don't buy the text book.",1Loved his stories and films.  Fun class.  Learned lots.,1the best teacher in the world.,0he may give the exam prior to actual test but half of the answers are not found in the textbook so whats the point...when each q is worth 3 points you can only make a minimum of 3 mistakes or forget the A or good grade in the class,1"Multiple choice questions are infuriating at times, there will be ones with more than one answer and ones where all answers are wrong. The part about them that was the most annoying is that for example if there are three correct choices and you miss one you miss the question and get minus points. That aside he is a very good friendly teacher.",1"Data Structures has been the hardest course I have taken to date. Requires you to do several hours of studying a night. If you don't show up for class or text/mess around during class expect to fail. On the flip side, he inspires the students to learn more about the topic. Even though I was struggling, I always enjoyed going to class to learn.",1"His quizes are hard, labs are challenging, but you learn alot and its a very worthwhile class.",1"He is a great astronomy professor and superb lecturer. Most of his content comes from lectures, but he makes it interesting. His tests aren't too difficult if you take good notes. Be careful of your TA, if you end up with a bad one, you will have to do extra to get a good grade.",1"Worse teacher I've had in my life. The material is relevant, but very hard due to his method of teaching. The exams are the main killer. Unless you are willing to focus all of your effort toward his class, expect a C. He killed my dreams and hopes.",0"She is the best math teacher I have ever had. She is funny, energetic, and goes out of her way to help you. I had her for both undergrad and grad level math! She rocks!",1Believes in a lot of group work in class. Pretty easy class overall though. Can revise essays for a better grade even after the due date. If you put in the work she will give you an A.,1"She is a fun teacher, and will try forever to help you understand the material. She wants to see you succeed, and will die trying. :)",1"Her class was easy, but she is the most unorganized person ever. She makes a lot of mistakes and is not always on time.",1"He's a great teacher. You just have to go home and independently studying to thoroughly understand everything. Tests are challenging, but he just wants to make sure you absolutely understand everything. No doubt, you'll learn and be challenged. If you do poorly, you're not trying hard enough. And if you need help, just ask.",1Cool professor. Strict but fun.,1Dr. is extremely helpful with clarification of portions of the subject that are not understood. She will even take the time to review your assignment before you submit it for grading.,1"I really enjoyed this class. It really separates serious students from the slackers. If you actually study, don't procrastinate, and seek help when you need it there is no reason you should fail this class, yet many people do. It is one of the most important CS classes you ever take and you need to treat it that way.",1"Tough teacher. Group projects are a thing now; do not procrastinate. The homework is online and there is at least one section due every week. Quiz every week. Not too many tests. Tests are tough but tend to be based off of the homework, quizzes, and labs.",1Great teacher all around!,0Favorite professor.,0No extra credit. Quiz every week. Unless you have taken this course before I advice to take another teacher or you will have to study a lot.,1"I love my professor. Her class is never boring. She uses the textbook, but always has Power Point or PDF's to help the understanding. What I like best, is she always relates everything to real life, so it makes it easy to understand and it makes sense. Also, she always give tricks on how to learn things, so they stay in your head forever.",1"Class is definitely difficult, but a very important one at that! Menezes knows his stuff, he doesn't always explain it THAT great, but he is a good teacher. Just don't expect any easy grade at all.",1"I just love her, her lectures are always on point and she explains everything you need to know for the tests.",1"Multiple choice questions are infuriating at times, there will be ones with more than one answer and ones where all answers are wrong. The part about them that was the most annoying is that for example if there are three correct choices and you miss one you miss the question and get minus points. That aside he is a very good friendly teacher.",1shes an okay professor. Her tests are tricky and youll really need to read the textbook. i didnt really attend classes cause its all from the book. she gives tons of extra credit. I got an A. it was too easy for me,1"He really knows his stuff, and is an effective instructor. However, he often shows an irritability with his students which undermines his frequent requests that students visit his office hours. In a few infrequent cases, he's tested on vocabulary that was not explicitly covered in class.",1"SHE TRIES TO BE FUNNY. In general, the class is easy but only if you do all the homework, quizzes and labs! everything! because there is a lot to cover in just one hour so you have to be on top of it. she is clear and fair. very helpful too! IN my opinion, her class goes with a good rhythm not too fast or too slow",0"Dr. is overall a very good teacher. Just show up to the lectures, she explains everything in a very clear fashion. The homework is once a week and not very hard. Would definitely reccomend.",1"Fair grader and tough tests, but very informative and helpful. Labs are easier and provide a well needed grade boost in the class.",1"Tests are fair, but very difficult. I got below a 50 on every pop quiz and the three tests so far I got a 40, 70, and 40. I came into this with a 3.7 but this is something else. I've never gotten below a B in my life but I will be happy with a C here. last test had 34Fs,6 Ds,5 Cs, 2 Bs, 1 A. only 1 A test avg with a 91% for the whole year.",1Smart guy. He helps students but does not chase us. If you need help you have to go and find him in his office. You learn a lot in the class. One of the best in the department.,1"I was forced to sort of take this class being a transfer student as other classes were filling up. I was very concerned after reading reviews from this site. The thing is, she's not that bad. She gave amazing lectures, she was well informed about the topics and very eloquent. She doesn't baby you, and she expects you to be independent.",1"Dr. Knoll is a genius. She teaches in a brilliant fashion and gives excellent notes. She can be intimidating and there is a lot of material. The grade mainly consists of quizzes and tests. The course requires effort, but in my opinion Dr. is the best choice to take it with. Had for calc 1 and 2.",1"The bomb.com! Get her for PreChem and Chem, and life is a breeze!",0"I liked her lectures very much. They were very interesting and she clearly knows a lot about her topics. (As all professors are supposed to) BUT, in the context of her grading style, she is not very planned nor is she organized. The distribution of percentages that determine ones grade are very very poorly set up.",1"She can make something difficult appear extremely easy. I was never fund of calculus, yet she made me love it. As always, for an A you have to study, but there is no ""hunt"" for formulas whatsoever. I never opened the book. No need! She is a MUST at FIT!",1He is the easiest A. He gives you the exams three weeks in advance.,1"One of the best math teachers I have ever had. She is super helpful and clear. Any issues I had with the class were with the GSAs. Homework can be difficult because it's through WebAssign, but it's not too bad honestly. Study the quizzes, and you'll do great on the tests. She does drop some grades, but I won't say exactly what was dropped.",1"Great teacher, available to students, HARD grader. This is probably the most valuable class you'll take as a CS student.",1>>>>>>> c5ce12f5c9275da1102514d09a8c7ead2d071530,
