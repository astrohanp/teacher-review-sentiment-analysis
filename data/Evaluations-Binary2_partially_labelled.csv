Review,Useful,
He was boring and ruined psychology for me. Nothing he ever said was clear and I would not recommend him if you want to pursue in psych. He's an easy grader but the pop quizzes everyday definitely made it hard to have a good quiz grade.,0,
"extremely difficult course. I thought I was going to have to retake it (like many others have to.) The labs are insanely hard and quite time consuming, and the pop quizzes are challenging. I think the tests should have easier questions but be longer. If you miss 2 multiple choice, you drop a letter grade. this course is VERY TIME CONSUMING",1,
Hard to understand at times. Tests are ok. Not too forgiving with grades.,1,
SO glad to be the hell out of this class,0,
"great teacher and very smart , the class is very hard and useful.",1,
Do not take her. She really is not interesting and is not a respectful individual. She treats her students like children. Take someone else. Very mean.,0,
"Awesome teacher. He's one of the few teachers whose lectures I can actually pay attention to. I'll go into the class dog tired but come out completely energized. Very funny, knowledgeable guy.",0,
"very good teacher loved the stories, i think he is one of the best on campus",1,
"I thought his class was extremely hard but despite it all, I became a confident writer. People on here say 'you can only get a c on a paper' WRONG. I got an A and a B. You just have to be in it to win it. If you want to get an A, get a different teacher. If you want learn, Go for Rand. He made Eng. 110 worth something.",1,
"I feel like people over-react about this class sometimes. Sure, his tests are not easy and he really expects you to know the content, but people shouldn't expect hand-holding at this stage in the game. People complain about arrogance but he was always very respectful when I went to talk to him. Class really separates the men from the boys.",1,
"This class was in the top two courses I've taken as a grad student at FIT. This course was challenging and extremely interesting. The discussion format of the course with his enthusiasm about swarm intelligence combined to create a fun and thought-provoking classroom atmosphere. The presentation and paper critiques were invaluable.One of the toughest classes out there, but he is one of the best teachers for it. Great guy, always willing to explain if somebody doesnt get it in the class. Is interested in the future of students; always asking for feedback. Very very tough grader, but one of the better CS majors.",1,
"I find everything okay except the grading on tests. I am okay with labs; it doesn't take me long to understand the concepts and to apply them. On tests, if you miss 2 multiple-choice questions, you drop a letter grade!!! It's terrible.",1,
Best calc teacher I could ask for. She is very clear about the expectations for quizzes/tests and teaches with examples that usually cover everything we are tested on. The lab sheets often have questions that are similar to the ones on the quizzes. Expect weekly homework on web assign and 3 group projects (easy). GSA was great too.,1,
"the class is very important and you will use every thing you will learn in you career however, if you can find a different teacher i advise you too because he makes the class very heavy on the student. most students fail the first time. Good luck",1,
"She is the best I ever had. She ginuinly cares about us, she want to know about our persinal life. She is always wiling to meet in her office. We even have her cell phone number. Strict, but fair. Ps:: she looks sexy in Facebook pictures",0,
"She is my best teacher in this university. She speaks clearly, she gives such good examples, I can understand what she is talking about. I think she makes the boring class very fun and the time goes fast in her class. She really knows her topic and so she is passionate about it. She is strict with attendence and turning paper in time, but if yo",1,
"She spends about five minutes on the lecture, and the rest of the time on applying whatever it is that we've learned, which is just how I like it. She's great about answering questions and clarifying anything you don't understand!",1,
"He's an interesting teacher when he lectures but much (most) of the course is done by student presentations. The problem is if a student presentation is missing information and he forgets to cover it, you may not clearly get the information you need for the test. He's also very unorganized. He doesn't seem to have a plan when he gets to class, he just wings it. Getting an ""A"" in the course was a challenge- but possible! He would be a great professor if he would just get organized.",1,
"He is brilliant in his field, but expects his students to perform at high levels, with unrealistic expectations. Only by a miracle did I get an A, and that was after a heavy curve. He does care about his students though, as he gives lots of time in class for work, while he goes around giving tips and answering questions.",1,
"Best mathematics professor I have ever had. Always keeps class entertaining, and she makes the material really easy to understand. Great in class examples. Go to lab and do the practice tests and there is no reason you should not get an A.",1,
"Good teacher with tough tests. Quizzes aren't too bad. She seems cruel at first, but after a few weeks she warms up to the class and tries to teach everybody the best she can. However, she isnt too good with outside the box, as in different random ways of doing things that aren't quite conventional.",0,
"Every bad thing you see here is true. He is as confused about basic astronomy as I am about how he is a professor at all. The best I can say is that he isn't an intentionally mean or rude person, but I can't say that he's nice because he's so annoying to be around. You'll do better in his course if you don't show up at all to lectures.",0,
"Being an engineer, classes like psych are hard for me, but I got an A in her class because she was very helpful, and rewards the amount of effort you put in. Fully recommended: participate in class, put the effort in, show her you're trying and you will score an A. Her being VERY CUTE makes the class so much more enjoyable as well ;)",0,
"she is very passionate about the subject which is a bonus bc she taught it well.exams straight from textbook. shes not that bad, she does have a little attitude sometimes but not a reason not to take her. she doesnt give much of direction or instructions which was the only thing i didnt like bc i wasnt sure what exactly she wanted",1,
"She is a great teacher, especially for C++! She teaches by lecture and example. She will teach about the basic concepts for the day by slide then she will show us some basic coding to get us to understand the concepts then we will dive into writing programs immediately!",1,
"If Sheldon Cooper also taught this class, I would have chosen Sheldon Cooper over this professor.",0,
This class is a shock to a lot of students because you actually need to study. If you study properly and don't procrastinate on the assignments you will be fine. He is a busy guy but if you try you will be able to get the help you need. He gives you past exams to help you study but you will need to actually understand the material to do well.,1,
one of the best lecturers I have ever seen.,0,
He has a major in philosophy which is why all the papers you have to write are based on philosophy. As long as your paper agrees with what he thinks you will get a good grade. Otherwise the class is boring and he talks for an hour about nonsense but it is mandatory to attend otherwise your grade will drop.,0,
"Best calc/mth teacher at FIT. Engages your mind & comedy is part of her specialty. Drops 3 quizzes at end of semester (shh, I wasn't supposed to tell). Favorite saying: ""If you factor a variable out of an integral, I deny you were in my calc class (or I cross ur name off Dr. Knoll's known student list.) Take her. Teaching is her calling and gift.",1,
She is an interesting person .. you can see her as a friend more than a doctor lolz,0,
"Terrible at teaching, actually, she doesn't teach. She expects you to just understand the material without any instruction. Terrible.",0,
Wouldn't surprise me if this guy turned out to be a fraud who's good at memorizing definitions from the book. I'd wager that his tests don't change that much from year to year because he doesn't understand the material well enough to make new tests. His GSA's are outstanding!,0,
"Hard final, useless professor. Prints out the textbook outlines and copies it onto the projector in class, making lecture useless. College classes in general are self study, but for this class you are on your own. Good luck.",0,
"the best comp. sci. teacher we have. he's really hard, but his teaching style forces you to learn. he makes you work for your grade such that each aspect ensures that you KNOW the material. better schools like berkeley and mit have teachers similar to him! so feel lucky to take a class with him!",1,
"I love her to death! She is the nicest person in the chem department. She really will die trying to help you if you come to her office, and it usually makes all the difference. Lecture may lose you, but def go to her office for help. Tests/quizes not that hard, and her grading is super generous on quizes. Really wants to see you succede.",1,
"He doesn't teach at all, takes him 30 mins to go over one question. It is so boring that you will fall asleep. Takes him forever to explain. He makes unfunny jokes. Good part is you will get a easy B or A, I got 60's for all his test, and I still got a A. Just come to class. and sleep. LOL",0,
"Fantastic, friendly, fair, funny, fascinating, flawless, fastidious, fervent,forgiving, festive & foxy. As Dr. says: ""thesaurus dot com should be your best friend.""",0,
"She is nice, and the class is really easy.",1,
"She likes long writings, if you try to be short and clear you would probably get low grade. Give her exact answer that she wants if your answer has the same meaning as hers but phrased differently she won't accept it. She does not accept the fact the people have different opinions, if you in her class you should think like her, strict on grades.",1,
Very difficult material. He tries to help make it clearer but he moves too fast. If you ask a question he makes you feel stupid. It is a required course and he is the only one teaching it so GOOD LUCK!!,1,
This is worst class I ever took. She's a hard grader and she is very rude when it comes to trying to talk to students about grades. She hurt my GPA & I had to take an extra class in order to get my GPA higher. Please avoid this class.,1,
"This is probably one of the best professors I have had. If you do not understand something, reach out to her as she will take the time to help you. It was because of this I was able to pass her class as at first I did not understand the material.",1,
"He was a good guy, really... he was. But I felt he had an alter-ego when he left to go home and grade. His expectations and how he picked apart his students papers was simply not fair. Again, great guy but avoid this class with him!!!",1,
She is not nice no matter what people are saying. I love math and i hated the way she was teaching it. I think she is fake with student and has a tendency to like only good students and not the one who struggle.,0,
"Excellent professor! I was very pleased to be in his class this semester, as he has a breadth of knowledge outside the classroom. His grading style is tough, but it works well, I believe.",1,
"Not all professors at FIT are great at teaching, they are brilliant but can't teach. She knows her content AND how to teach exceptionally well as a college professor.",1,
This class has been a waste of time. She spends most of the time just talking about what we're going to learn. And then just lectures on about random current events. She doesn't set a clear objective for class each day. Pointless syllabus. I've learned almost nothing from her class and frankly I'm not sure she knows what she's doing as a professor.,0,
"She's a great teacher! She seems a little nuts, but that's what makes her teaching awesome and funny!",0,
Labs are unnecessarily hard and annoying. Tests are very tricky.,1,
"What a joke, class average for the exams was less than 50, and more than half the class dropped. She should be ashamed of herself.",0,
"Great professor, teaches all the content really well. She has never missed a class but will be late because she is spending so much time meeting students to help them out. Really smart and nice, just don't forget to call her Dr. Pay attention and do the homework and you'll do really well.",1,
"He knows what he is teaching and he know what others thinking, you got a question ir your mind and he will gonna give you the answer even before u ask&#63; very tough in grading, everyone should take a course with him atleast once.",1,
I took her for Developmental Math since my last Algebra class was more than 40 years ago. She is very willing to sit with you and explain problems and is genuinely wanting you to succeed. Managed with her help to take all 3 sections in one semester and get it done!,1,
"Any professor that throws markers in frustration is a good professor. ^_^ All in all, my favorite math professor.",0,
Shares applicable stories in class to relate to material. . .entertaining!!,1,
"The professor is AMAZING. The class structure is AWFUL. If there was no lab portion for this class, everybody would get an easy A. BUT, the lab portion is the hardest part of this class. Some lab sections are led by ""instructors"" who don't know how to do anything. Lecture exams are based only on her slides and notes which is great because no book",1,
Made the class very interesting. Loved his stories!,1,
"That said, she was awful. Students would correct her all the time on simple problems, and she often couldn't answer things where there was legitimate confusion. She once wore her sweater backwards and inside-out and never noticed. She also ended class abruptly once after realizing she had written all over the white board with permanent marker.",0,
I learned a lot this semester. Don't purchase the book as it is not used. He is a very harsh grader. The labs are very difficult. His tests SUCK. I attended all classes and failed all of his tests. He killed all of my career goals as a Computer Science professor. This class makes me want to kill myself!,0,
His lectures inspire you to learn about the subject. The course is not very easy but is an essential for any CS student. Dr. is always willing to help you and explains the concepts in a clear way.,1,
"Dr. is excellent. Her lectures go very fast you need to be focused. It is easy to let your grade slip, but as long as effort is put into the class it's fine. She is very passionate and has lots of energy.",1,
"In a nutshell, this professor looks for every excuse to give students a bad grade. Even if you give him high-quality work, he will never have anything good to say about it and will always complain about even the smallest imperfections; a single small imperfections in your work could totally undermine a good grade.",1,
"This is the worst professor that I have ever had. I ultimately ended up failing the course and I have never received lower than a B- for a lower grade. When I went into her office hours to address my grade, she wouldn't talk about past assignments and when asked if I could speak she said, ""no, because you are wrong."" Avoid this class!",1,
I do not recommend her. She is hugely disorganized - all of the readings are on BB so I spent a fortune printing and the syllabus did not match the readings. The first half of the semester she spent telling the same 3 stories. Her assignments are stupid & the midterm was much too hard for this class. She only wants to hear what she believes.,0,
"This professor is arrogant and does not care about his students. In fact, he seems to take pleasure failing students. Whenever he finds out you don't know something (like if you were to ask him a question), he will berate you for that. While he expects students to finish an exam in one hour, he stalls on grading the exams gives a lot of excuses.",1,
"DO NOT TAKE HER! the class is ridiculously hard, the reading is equivalent to like 10 books and she just rambles on and on about how great Africa is. Uses all kind of propoganda to back her stuff up and she hates that shes white.",0,
"Professor is a very kind lady. If you goto her office hours she really tries to help you understand the material. She's not the most organized, always running late, but she gives alot of oppurtunities to boost up your grade. If you need an extension she will give it to you. Goto office hours, study hard you'll do well. She grades fair.",1,
"very good prof. class contains lots of reading. you dont have to do them all, but you must pay attention to what she saya. the midterm is fear, and the final is a take-home. she is extreamly nice...also, be very openminded in the class, and get ready to decunstruct all you've learned about africa.",1,
"She's a real sweetheart. Attendance counts for this class, so at least make sure you show up. Her lectures are easy to follow and she covers everything needed for the homework or exams. She always makes it a point to tell you what types of problems you should focus on for the exams. Best teacher for a freshman Chem class.",1,
"I think all of the nice comments were written by himself. &quot;Always willing to help&quot;, give me a break! Unfortunately he's the only one teaching this class.",1,
"Gotta take this course. Even if you fail, you will end up doing yourself world of good. Whatever the heck be your major or reason to take the course, you get a chance, take it and put some effort, otherwise you will regret it for your entire life.",1,
Simply amazing. She is very clear and likes to make things simpler rather than more complicated. Funny as well! If you study and do your homework you'll be more than fine!,1,
"This professor is all over the place when teaching and can be difficult to keep up with. However, what I really enjoyed was his passion and knowledge on Puerto Rican studies. His assigned readings will help organize his lectures. There were two exams, the final was a 3-5 page paper and that was pretty much it.",1,
"Prof. has a big course load. She does not make room for the students responsibilities outside of class. The books that she makes students buy are too expensive. She expects a lot from students but she doesn't deliver herself. Unfair, unjust and unreasonable. Her knowledge of social injustices are just that. She is smart but not wise. Avoid.",0,
"Too much pride and arrogance. He thinks that just because he has a phD, he has the right to rub it in our faces that he is more knowledgeable than we are in Computer Science and arrogantly berate those who don't know what he knows. We don't need a professor who shoves it up our faces that he knows more than we do, we just need a prof who teaches.",1,
"Yes, this class is time consuming. In my opinion, the lecture exams were easy as hell. You don't really need the textbook, because the prof puts all her notes and lectures slides up before lectures. Exams are based only from her notes (Not textbook). The Lab Portion, was easy as well. I had to put in alot of effort in memorizing, other than that A+",1,
"Best teacher in the history of like, FOREVER! Always happy and willing to help! She's here for her students and it shows! She hasn't been here 35 years for her health, you know! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",1,
"average teacher, very very harsh grader",1,
"I recently just finished taking Comp 110 with him and it was the hardest class of my freshman semester. He takes it way too serious for a 100 level class. 80% of the class is papers so you would think you control the grade you get, right? Wrong.  He will tear apart your paper and give you a bad grade despite your efforts. I worked hard for a C.",1,
"decent teacher, expect to work a lot, and don't expect a good grade.",1,
"Hardest and Best teacher ever. If you get an A in his class you are destined for greatness. Most helpfull and approachable teacher in the Computer Science department. If you are lazy and not smart, don't take a course with him.",1,
Cool!,0,
Professor is an amazing person but not a professor who can teach you the physics that you need for the rest of your life. Its hard to understand her. exams and quizzes are not bad.. Just do homework and stay on top of the material on your own and you will get that A!,1,
Terrible teacher and doesn't care to help his students in any way.,1,
I absolutely love her. She makes math easy. Pretty funny and good for help outside of class.,1,
"He teaches a tough class, but graciously curves as well. Tests are very hard, the labs aren't too bad. The semester long team project makes your grade for the most part. He is a fun teacher but loves playing devil's advocate in class discussions.",1,
"This was a pretty boring class in my opinion. You don't really need the textbook, it was a waste of money. Just take notes on the power point slides and study the online quizzes .",0,
"Multiple choice questions are infuriating at times, there will be ones with more than one answer and ones where all answers are wrong. The part about them that was the most annoying is that for example if there are three correct choices and you miss one you miss the question and get minus points. That aside he is a very good friendly teacher.",1,
Life Changing,0,
"Nice teacher. Looks scary at first, but cares about your grade. Not entirely clear and sometimes doesn't explain things too well. Tests were difficult, but not impossible.",0,
"Simply amazing. The classes are more like a group discussion than a lecture. Each student had to do give a presentation about a specific topic and write a paper by the end of the semester. We discussed the subject, ideas, helped each other and learned. We read a lot. There's a list of papers for each class. It definitely worth it. It's a great area",1,
"Class consists of 5 writing assignments, in class midterm(short answers)and take home final. The assignments are easy if you actually do the readings and listen in class. Otherwise you'll find yourself stressing, looking over the thousands of readings on blackboard looking for the answers. She is really nice and understanding in person.",1,
Lectures are long,1,
"Her lectures are boring but attendance is mandatory. Videos shown in class will appear on tests. There are 4 exams, the final one cumulative and optional. She offers a lot of extra credit that will boost your grade. Read the book, study her slides, take occasional notes and you should do fine. The subject itself is interesting.",1,
"Hum...He knows his stuff, but unless you already know yours, you aren't likely to learn much.",1,
"I found it very hard to succeed in this class. You have access to past exams, but they're unanswered. It's difficult to study because you never know if your answer is correct, even with the internet. The labs are generally time consuming and of medium-hard difficulty, but you basically must get an A in the labs to get a C in the class.",1,
"Plays around way too much in class, takes more time trying to be ""relatable"" than actually teaching anything.",0,
"He is the one of the best professors i've had so far at FIT. His exams are tricky (not hard) and his grading is very strict, but that's because he really wants you to learn the material. I think everyone that is complaining about his class wants to get a good grade, without actually earning it.",1,
He is such a great guy. He is very young and therefore will act as one of us. He blends extremely well with the class and prepares you both for the material as well as for the real life applications. Great way to start your Aviation Career!,1,
He's pretty cool,0,
An Interesting Class,0,
Best teacher ever! She takes time to explain everything clearly. She REALLY cares about all the students. She wants us to be successful. She always smile. She is always available. Answers e-mail quickly. She understands how difficult it is for foreign students. We need more teachers like her.,1,
"Psychology is an interesting topic i believe if you really want to learn more about it, than its good to ask questions after class. if you're there just to pass, i recommend to study the problem sets and beware of those quizzes. his quizzes are pretty tough but he gives the students tons of opportunities like writing assignment, studyQs. HES GREAT!",1,
"Awesome prof.! Great guy in general... always there for help. He also understands how pilots dont like showing that they dont know something, so he always offers private help. Fun to work with.",1,
The GSA in this class does a lot more work than this professor. We're better off if the GSA taught the class instead.,1,
GSA taught most of the classes. The professor is department head. Had another professor offer to teach the class how ever the professor is too selfish and would not allow it. Not much on test is taught in the class.,1,
Explains concepts well,1,
"He is one of the best teachers I have ever had. His class is very difficult, but you will learn so much.",1,
"Although Prof may be all over the place during lectures, she truly does care about her students. Make use of her office hours for sure because she is always open to explaining things that may have been unclear during lecture. She really wants her students to succeed so do not hesitate in asking her for help.",1,
"One Of those Professors who cant speak english , nor has any interest towards teaching, but feels great for some reason .",0,
"Failing the class, mainly due to the super-tough exams.",1,
I am taking her class next semester. Very good at getting across what we needto know. hard class but great!,1,
"She wants you to do well in the class. She is very helpful and will set up study sessions. Make sure to pay attention in class and study for the tests. She is easy to understand and she acknowledges that teaching off slides is not her favorite way of teaching, but she must. Very cute teacher.",0,
"Very easy A+! He is a really sweet old guy, as long as you sit in the right spot and don't break his focus! If you like absolutely no work and can take lots of anectdotal stories about his life and past patients, this is the class for you.",1,
"She is awesome, if you study and attend lecture you'll be fine. Don't buy the text book.",1,
Loved his stories and films.  Fun class.  Learned lots.,1,
the best teacher in the world.,0,
he may give the exam prior to actual test but half of the answers are not found in the textbook so whats the point...when each q is worth 3 points you can only make a minimum of 3 mistakes or forget the A or good grade in the class,1,
"Multiple choice questions are infuriating at times, there will be ones with more than one answer and ones where all answers are wrong. The part about them that was the most annoying is that for example if there are three correct choices and you miss one you miss the question and get minus points. That aside he is a very good friendly teacher.",1,
"Data Structures has been the hardest course I have taken to date. Requires you to do several hours of studying a night. If you don't show up for class or text/mess around during class expect to fail. On the flip side, he inspires the students to learn more about the topic. Even though I was struggling, I always enjoyed going to class to learn.",1,
"His quizes are hard, labs are challenging, but you learn alot and its a very worthwhile class.",1,
"He is a great astronomy professor and superb lecturer. Most of his content comes from lectures, but he makes it interesting. His tests aren't too difficult if you take good notes. Be careful of your TA, if you end up with a bad one, you will have to do extra to get a good grade.",1,
"Worse teacher I've had in my life. The material is relevant, but very hard due to his method of teaching. The exams are the main killer. Unless you are willing to focus all of your effort toward his class, expect a C. He killed my dreams and hopes.",0,
"She is the best math teacher I have ever had. She is funny, energetic, and goes out of her way to help you. I had her for both undergrad and grad level math! She rocks!",1,
Believes in a lot of group work in class. Pretty easy class overall though. Can revise essays for a better grade even after the due date. If you put in the work she will give you an A.,1,
"She is a fun teacher, and will try forever to help you understand the material. She wants to see you succeed, and will die trying. :)",1,
"Her class was easy, but she is the most unorganized person ever. She makes a lot of mistakes and is not always on time.",1,
"He's a great teacher. You just have to go home and independently studying to thoroughly understand everything. Tests are challenging, but he just wants to make sure you absolutely understand everything. No doubt, you'll learn and be challenged. If you do poorly, you're not trying hard enough. And if you need help, just ask.",1,
Cool professor. Strict but fun.,1,
Dr. is extremely helpful with clarification of portions of the subject that are not understood. She will even take the time to review your assignment before you submit it for grading.,1,
"I really enjoyed this class. It really separates serious students from the slackers. If you actually study, don't procrastinate, and seek help when you need it there is no reason you should fail this class, yet many people do. It is one of the most important CS classes you ever take and you need to treat it that way.",1,
"Tough teacher. Group projects are a thing now; do not procrastinate. The homework is online and there is at least one section due every week. Quiz every week. Not too many tests. Tests are tough but tend to be based off of the homework, quizzes, and labs.",1,
Great teacher all around!,0,
Favorite professor.,0,
No extra credit. Quiz every week. Unless you have taken this course before I advice to take another teacher or you will have to study a lot.,1,
"I love my professor. Her class is never boring. She uses the textbook, but always has Power Point or PDF's to help the understanding. What I like best, is she always relates everything to real life, so it makes it easy to understand and it makes sense. Also, she always give tricks on how to learn things, so they stay in your head forever.",1,
"Class is definitely difficult, but a very important one at that! Menezes knows his stuff, he doesn't always explain it THAT great, but he is a good teacher. Just don't expect any easy grade at all.",1,
"I just love her, her lectures are always on point and she explains everything you need to know for the tests.",1,
"Multiple choice questions are infuriating at times, there will be ones with more than one answer and ones where all answers are wrong. The part about them that was the most annoying is that for example if there are three correct choices and you miss one you miss the question and get minus points. That aside he is a very good friendly teacher.",1,
shes an okay professor. Her tests are tricky and youll really need to read the textbook. i didnt really attend classes cause its all from the book. she gives tons of extra credit. I got an A. it was too easy for me,1,
"He really knows his stuff, and is an effective instructor. However, he often shows an irritability with his students which undermines his frequent requests that students visit his office hours. In a few infrequent cases, he's tested on vocabulary that was not explicitly covered in class.",1,
"SHE TRIES TO BE FUNNY. In general, the class is easy but only if you do all the homework, quizzes and labs! everything! because there is a lot to cover in just one hour so you have to be on top of it. she is clear and fair. very helpful too! IN my opinion, her class goes with a good rhythm not too fast or too slow",0,
"Dr. is overall a very good teacher. Just show up to the lectures, she explains everything in a very clear fashion. The homework is once a week and not very hard. Would definitely reccomend.",1,
"Fair grader and tough tests, but very informative and helpful. Labs are easier and provide a well needed grade boost in the class.",1,
"Tests are fair, but very difficult. I got below a 50 on every pop quiz and the three tests so far I got a 40, 70, and 40. I came into this with a 3.7 but this is something else. I've never gotten below a B in my life but I will be happy with a C here. last test had 34Fs,6 Ds,5 Cs, 2 Bs, 1 A. only 1 A test avg with a 91% for the whole year.",1,
Smart guy. He helps students but does not chase us. If you need help you have to go and find him in his office. You learn a lot in the class. One of the best in the department.,1,
"I was forced to sort of take this class being a transfer student as other classes were filling up. I was very concerned after reading reviews from this site. The thing is, she's not that bad. She gave amazing lectures, she was well informed about the topics and very eloquent. She doesn't baby you, and she expects you to be independent.",1,
"Dr. Knoll is a genius. She teaches in a brilliant fashion and gives excellent notes. She can be intimidating and there is a lot of material. The grade mainly consists of quizzes and tests. The course requires effort, but in my opinion Dr. is the best choice to take it with. Had for calc 1 and 2.",1,
"The bomb.com! Get her for PreChem and Chem, and life is a breeze!",0,
"I liked her lectures very much. They were very interesting and she clearly knows a lot about her topics. (As all professors are supposed to) BUT, in the context of her grading style, she is not very planned nor is she organized. The distribution of percentages that determine ones grade are very very poorly set up.",1,
"She can make something difficult appear extremely easy. I was never fund of calculus, yet she made me love it. As always, for an A you have to study, but there is no ""hunt"" for formulas whatsoever. I never opened the book. No need! She is a MUST at FIT!",1,
He is the easiest A. He gives you the exams three weeks in advance.,1,
"One of the best math teachers I have ever had. She is super helpful and clear. Any issues I had with the class were with the GSAs. Homework can be difficult because it's through WebAssign, but it's not too bad honestly. Study the quizzes, and you'll do great on the tests. She does drop some grades, but I won't say exactly what was dropped.",1,
"Great teacher, available to students, HARD grader. This is probably the most valuable class you'll take as a CS student.",1,
"He was a good guy, really... he was. But I felt he had an alter-ego when he left to go home and grade. His expectations and how he picked apart his students papers was simply not fair. Again, great guy but avoid this class with him!!!",1,
"He is brilliant in his field, but expects his students to perform at high levels, with unrealistic expectations. Only by a miracle did I get an A, and that was after a heavy curve. He does care about his students though, as he gives lots of time in class for work, while he goes around giving tips and answering questions.",1,
He has a major in philosophy which is why all the papers you have to write are based on philosophy. As long as your paper agrees with what he thinks you will get a good grade. Otherwise the class is boring and he talks for an hour about nonsense but it is mandatory to attend otherwise your grade will drop.,0,
"I thought his class was extremely hard but despite it all, I became a confident writer. People on here say 'you can only get a c on a paper' WRONG. I got an A and a B. You just have to be in it to win it. If you want to get an A, get a different teacher. If you want learn, Go for him. He made Eng. 110 worth something.",1,
"I recently just finished taking Comp 110 with Rand and it was the hardest class of my freshman semester. He takes it way too serious for a 100 level class. 80% of the class is papers so you would think you control the grade you get, right? Wrong. He will tear apart your paper and give you a bad grade despite your efforts. I worked hard for a C.",1,
"He is a nice person and really interesting to hear him speak. I am always inspired after a lecture. However, never expect to get anything higher than a C. You can think your paper is perfect but, he will tear it apart in seconds. Take a different professor if you don't want to put 9 hours of work into a paper you get an 'average' grade on.",1,
Hard class,0,
He graded a 100 level class like we were all English majors in a 300 or above level class. Never got higher than a C on a paper. I went to the writing center for every paper. Very unclear in instructions and hard to approach with questions. Don't take the class from him.,1,
Tough grader on papers make sure you do your work and drafts. Participation grades save you in the long run. Dont miss class and do your work. Go to the tutor center helps alot,1,
Do not take English 110 with him. I don't feel any better at writing due to his confusing grading style.,1,
Bottom line Rand needs to retire before he ruins everyone's GPA's. He thinks he knows so much about English and thinks it is his job to make essay assignments unneeded riddles. He answers questions with questions and likes to talk trash about high school English teachers; hating on the high school teachers ironically makes it like high school. FR,0,
He will only give your paper a C. It does not matter if it is good or not. Work extremely hard if you plan on passing.,1,
one of the worst professors at UND. Extremely hard grader and expects to much in a 100 level class. Thinks that everyone's papers should be masterpieces. No matter how long i spent on a paper i couldnt get higher than a C. Only reason i got a B in the class was because i never missed a class.,0,
"This class is so pointless its ridiculous. I'm in the class currently (only because its required.) The class has no relevance to anything in life. He is a ****, the class is so boring. He could make the class so much better by writing papers that actually have meaning to them instead of what some philosopher said. Textbook reading is hard!!",0,
Horrible professor. He does not believe in A's. Thinks that other teachers grade too easily. Answers your questions with other questions that do not help you. Teaches you irrelevant material that you will never use again. Worst professor I have ever had.,0,
"Worst professor ever. He asked me personal questions that were uncomfortable, made me feel stupid when I asked questions, and overall discouraged me. Do not take english 125 from him.",1,
"I attend his Business and Technical Writing course. He humiliates people for not understanding assignments when they ask. Very egotistical, rude to those who need help, very difficult work, hard grader -even on those who are following directions. I highly recommend waiting to take this class from anyone else. Not worth losing points on your GPA.",1,
"He was a very hard grader, but he graded on improvement throughout the semester, not on how great of a greater you were (I mean he obviously graded on how good of a writer you were, but it was more on how much you progressed). I learned a lot from him. I am even taking me next english class with him. Definitely take his course if you can!",1,
"Professor is very unclear and grades very hard. If you are in his English classes, drop if you want something less than a C. He hates that 'students were graded too easy in high school' so in response to that, he likes to fail his students.",0,
"He is terrible! If you have him drop him IMMEDIATELY! He is mean, and an extremely hard grader!!!!",0,
Awful. Horrible grading.,0,
I wish I could give him a zero,0,
Not good.,0,
"This was a tough class. I expected all college classes to be like this, but since most are not it was somewhat refreshing to have a professor push me this much. If you are willing to put in the work for Mr. you will reep the benefits. If not, then take this class from someone else.",1,
"He is a unruly professor. He grades on how he feels your ideas are. There is never a right answer, papers can ALWAYS use improvement. I would not recommend him to anyone wanting a grade over a C, even to get that you must put in an excessive amount of time into each paper.",1,
"He is confusing in every aspect: in lecture, in assignments and in critiquing. His assignments are mundane and never change. I expected to explore writing and become better. He is an impossible grader, espcially because he grades on how HE feels about your ideas, not on grammer or content. VERY DISAPPOINTING.",1,
"Worst teacher I have had at UND. Sorry I don't have a PhD in English. His grading style is way too rough for a 125 class. nobody in my class has an A. I have put in 3x more hours for this class than any other but still this class is my worst grade. If possible, avoid this teacher!",1,
worst experience of my life. expects way too much for a 100 level course. take this class if you want to spend 15 hours on a three page paper and still get a C-. ridiculous grading policies.,0,
"For as much of a waste as UNIV 101 is, he did an ok job at keeping things interesting. Avoid UNIV 101 altogether if you can.",1,
"His expectations are high for a required 100-level class, especially since most who take it aren't English majors. To his credit, he's smart and gives good feedback. I wouldn't recommend him to a freshman.",1,
He just a joke!! and so incrediablely socially awkward! do not take this class unless you like to fail out of college! He gives you directions for a paper but grades on whatever is on his mind that day his grading makes no sense and no one has ever gotten an A in one of his classes yet.... if you dont believe me he will tell you this.,0,
"I struggled through his class. First- he's a lawyer, so he'll lead you on making you think one thing without actually promising anything. Second- he'll give you about 20 different instructions on one paper and he'll grade it by how he's feeling. Stupid class, I worked so hard and managed a B but he told me that I had &quot;weak writing.&quot; Avoid him!",0,
"Hey be nice. Yeah, he's hard to understand, and a very harsh grader, but he's a teacher and at least he's doing his job (of course, everyone including me would love easier, more comprehendable classes) just be greatful he's willing to put up with everyone's bull hoping that he helped at least one student improve in literature.",1,
"He was the absolute worst professor i have ever had. He's without a doubt the hardest teacher you can take for any english classes. He grades extremely hard, and not at the level of a 100 class. Also he is the biggest &quot;Creeper&quot; he makes everyone around him feel extremely uncomfortable.",1,
"This is the hardest 100 level class ever. It doesn't matter if you dedicate your life to this class, you still won't get an A! Take it a another semester or with a different professor. His directions are unclear. He goes against everything the book says, but tells you to use the book. He's confusing, a hard grader, and a different guy. STAY AWAY!!",1,
"I am currently in this class. I took this, because I was told it was supposed to be easier than 120. I regret staying in this class with him as my Professor. He is nice and pretty smart, but his grading is ridiculous. He is the hardest grader I have ever encountered.DONT take him, if you are taking this class as a general basically. LISTEN.",1,
"I took 125 because I heard it was easier than 120 unless you get a certain professor. Well this is that professor. He's a nice guy but expects perfection and is out of touch with reality. The class is boring and hard, and the book is expensive. First paper was 3-4 pages, last will be 15 with each in between getting larger. Would NOT recommend him.",1,
This was by far the best learning experience I have had at UND. He is a hard grader but he helps by marking your papers with serious suggestions. I feel that many mistake his marks for personal attacks when he is only trying to bring the best out in his students. My writing skills have improved a hundred fold. I would recommend him to anyone.,1,
"I should have read these comments before I took this class. This was by far the worse teacher I have had! He makes you feel dumb and expects way to much for a 100 level class. Worked my butt off to get a B in the course! If you can, please switch to another teacher, you will be thankful you did!! He expects everyone is an English Major!",0,
I suggest never taking him...i read the comments on here but figured it wouldnt be so bad so stayed in...wrong move...trust me..get out of the class ASAP...his instructions were never clear and he made you write the paper then changed his assignment my advice for the writers group is to just write a bunch of crap because you'll rewrite it anyway,0,
"horrible teacher, i had to transfer out of state i hated this guy so much",0,
He was a very unfair teacher... i suggest NOT taking him!,0,
IMPOSSILE! If it is still possible to drop this class... DO IT!! It is not possible to get above a C. And to just get a C you have to work your butt off!,0,
"I think he is a great guy to just talk about music, and fun stuff outside of school, but he never answers questions you have, and gives like a couple B's in the class the rest... you know...",1,
what can i say about him....those of you who hate him so much should be lucky that you didn't have to endure his class five days a week for six weeks for an hour and a half each day....YOU SHOULD FEEL SOMEWHAT LUCKY!,0,
This man is the devil trapped in human form. It is currently 2:42am the day before this final paper and I want to gouge my eyes out. If I could give some advice to future students I would recommend dropping at the soonest possible moment and save yourself some time before drop day or prepare to spend 8 hours writing papers to get a C-.I despise him,0,
Impossible to a get above a C- on anything!!! He treats you like you are an employee of a Rocket science nasa program or something......Nice guy but a lil out of touch with reality,1,
he sucks...and he wants you to fail at life...stay away.. far away...,0,
"It is impossible to get a good grade. If you get a B, congradulations, i think you're a first. he is an unfair grader. I went to the writing center when he worked and had him look at my paper, made all the changes he told me to do and still go a C. I spent way too much time on his papers. If you have him, get out now!!!!!!",,
Never understood what was asking for because he never told you what he really wanted you to do. He's a total ****.,0,
impossible to get a good grade,1,
"hes pretty tough, expects too much",1,
"He expects a lot from his students, but does take the time to get to know everyone. I'd suggest going to the writing lab before you ask him for help..and he tends to suggest that too, or else be prepared for a lot of red ink.",1,
this guy is hard as nails. all he did was whup my ass when I asked for help,0,
He sucks,0,
He Hated me .... never taught us how to write,0,
Rediculous teacher...kills you on stupid details,0,
"The course is difficult, but doable. Mr. will help you, but the key to this course is to use math learning center. He is a professor that wants to see you pass so he tries to help as much as possible.",1,
"Everyday there is a WebAssign assignment given out (very time consuming and they don't help you on the exams). The three exams he gives are extremely HARD!, all I can say is just practice ... a lot. I got a F on my first exam and had to ace the rest to get an A overall. lastly, the final will wreck you, the girl sitting next to me cried during it.",1,
"Mr. is one of the nicest people you will meet. WebAssign assignments get handed out every day after class to practice problems and a quiz usually appears every day at class. Do a lot of practice questions for the 3 midterm tests. For the final he makes you understand the concepts instead of memorizing problems. Put the work in, get an A.",1,
"Tests are hard because they never matched up with notes and lectures. On the final test, we had to get a 70% on it or we didn't pass the Everything that you think is gonna be on the test, is not. Expect homework 4 days a week. Would not recommend.",1,
"Mr. is the best math teacher I have ever had. He is super funny and very passionate about what he does. There is a quiz almost every day in class, but it is not the end of the world if you miss one.",1,
Take this class with a different prof,0,
He will answer all the questions you have. And he is willing to give his students a second chance to take passed due hw. Random in class quizzes is easy!,1,
He is among the nicest professors I've ever had. Unfortunately this didn't translate into him being an effective one. Prepare for loads of homework and daily quizzes.,1,
"If you take a class with him, be ready to spend A LOT of time outside of class on homework, often times teaching yourself unfortunately. Also, there is a quiz in class pretty much every day, so go! The homework is challenging and time consuming, but the tests are much easier which is nice. He isn't the best at explaining material, but ok.",1,
Terrible teacher all around. Had him my first year in college for math and got stuck with him again my junior year and nothing changed.. he maybe even got worse..,0,
Nice person but absolutely sucks at teaching math. This class is supposed to be for students who are below the average math scores but he makes it so difficult. I'm bad at math to start with and he doesn't help. Avoid him at all costs.,0,
"I took Math 92 and 93 in one semester, it was very fast paced. If you missed any class you would be behind for a while. All in all he was a good teacher, I think a lot of people didn't like moving at that pace and in turn disliked him.",1,
"Took this class for interest, also was the first math course in College. It was very hard to start with, extensive and new HW every class(Webassign), Prepare to do them, with solid understanding. attendence are vital. Test are very based on in class assignments and lecture examples.",1,
"He has homework almost nightly, but it nothing that wasn't able to be done quickly for the most part. His final test accounted for the most percentage of the points in the class so studying is mandatory if you want to pass this class.",1,
"If you don't show your work or show that you double checked your answers he'll give you a zero, even if you got the question right. Also you can't skip because he does in class practice that you turn in at the end of the class.",1,
Very Nice guy. very willing to help,1,
"Mr. is the nicest man you will ever meet. His concepts are easy to figure out. As long as you pay attention and show up, you will be fine.",1,
Kinda quirky but he's a good guy that cares. Show up everyday for free points. Quizzes almost every week (turned into group quizzes by the end of the semester). Test very similar to quizzes. Homework almost every day and it is much harder than what you will see on the quizzes/test though if you ask for extensions you'll get it every time. Math On!,1,
"Kind of weird, makes corny jokes all the time but one of the better math professors I've had. He's passionate about the subject and it shows. He spends extra time making sure that his students understand the reasons behind why you do certain steps and, for me, it was helpful in my understanding. Recommended.",1,
"This class is a giant headache. So far, we've had over 30 assignments(only worth 20% of grade) that each take hours to complete, because he puts many problems that we never went over in class . On top of that, we have weekly comprehensive quizzes that are inconsistent in difficulty and points. Simply, I pity anyone who has to take this class.",1,
I would not recommend this professor if you' re not strong in math. You should expect to do homework almost every night. New homework assignment after each class. Doesn't give traditional exams but weekly quizzes for points. Text book assigned was of little help. Homework take hours to complete for only small portion of grade.,1,
"He, so far, has been the worst professor I have had. He grades so harshly that it is almost impossible to get even a C. (At one point I had a 48%) (& Im the average A/B student) He gives weekly quizzes and gives time consuming homework. I would not recommend him.",1,
"He is the worst teacher that I have had for the past ten years. He goes way overboard with trying to explain things, and when he does explain things, it doesn't show up on the test or quizzes. There are many other students in my class that have no idea what is going on. Don't take any of his classes. You have to teach yourself the lessons.",1,
He is a fantastic guy that is very easy to get along with. Greets you with a smile every day and is excited to see you each and every day and tries to make the class fun. Defenitly introduce yourself to him. He is confusing in his explaining of concepts. He tends to over-explain where it gets confusing. He is a very respectable person.,1,
"He is a nice guy and cares about his students, but that doesn't result in effective teaching or keeping the class engaged. He doesn't seem to understand that students taking Math146 are the least likely to raise there hand and contribute, and you can't have a discussion with 100 people. For grades, watch him like a hawk and email him ASAP.",1,
"Mr. is a good teacher, but is not quite clear on the types of questions we need to go over. The homework and in-class assignments are a lot tougher than the actual exams.",1,
"Mr. was a nice guy and tried to make everyone laugh. But points wise I had an A, because of his curve I had a C. He never explained anything and if you asked him a question he never seemed to answer it. I would avoid taking his class, unless you want to fail.",1,
"Professor is a nice guy and wants you to do well, but he is very confusing. Avoid him if possible. I took Math93 with him, and although it's very simple math, he makes if somehow difficult. I hadn't had math since my junior year of high school, so I had to take this. His explanations make things more difficult. Have to teach yourself.",1,
"His class was not too bad, but he tries very hard to get the attention of his students by cracking corny jokes. I skipped class most of the time, and did not miss much.",1,
"Gives easy examples in class when teaching, then when it comes to web assign homework its harder stuff that he never taught, only teaches the basic examples and expects you to take it from there on your own.",1,
"Open a new tab, go on Campus Connection and change to a different calc 147 class with a different teacher. RIGHT NOW. Trust me and everyone else on here who has taken this class. Gave me multiple zero's on test problems for not doing the question 'his way' even thought the answer was correct.",0,
"Mr. knows math and he wants you to learn. Don't expect him to just give you the answers. He will answer any and every question and clarify anything you need. Attend class, do the assignments and you'll do fine. Gives 2 tests (10 questions each) and final (15 questions). Super nice, nerdy guy who's motto is 'Math on!'",1,
"Terrible at teaching, absolutely no help when asking questions, and was rude to his own students.",0,
"Mr. Farm is in the top 3 of the worst teachers I have ever had. He assigns work that you did not cover on web assign (the worst way to do math homework). He is not very helpful, and is very odd. Avoid this professor at all costs, he will make an easy subject hard to comprehend.",0,
"Like others have said, he seems like a great guy, and is very willing to help his students. That said, he spends most of every lecture period answering questions from current or previous assignments and then only lectures on new material for 10 min. So I basically have had to teach myself the material which makes it super tough and time consuming",1,
"Is a very nice teacher, but hard to understand his lectures. He expects you to know too much coming into the class, and goes far over the students head's while lecturing. WebAssign assignments are long and hard as he doesn't go over any of it in class. Lots of out of class homework.",1,
"Seems like a nice guy, but he expects you to know calculus coming into the class and doesn't give much for notes.",1,
"Annoying, not helpful. Incredibly unclear.",0,
He tries his best to make sure everyone gets the help they need. He tries to make lecture fun. He gives a lot of homework but will extend deadline to the amount of time you need to get done. He is a good guy.,1,
The amount of homework is absolutely ridiculous and he doesn't explain anything very well in calss,0,
I got an A in my high school precalc class. I decided to retake this after being out of school for nearly 2 years. I only managed a D in this class. I could not understand anything he was teaching. My girlfriend didn't even know and she was in calc 2. Over taught everything beyond most of the class' knowledge.,0,
Mr. is hands down just not clear in any area of the classes he teaches. It seems that there is about a 5050 split between students who get what he is teaching and those who don't. I would not recommend taking a class with him.,0,
He makes college algebra into rocket science. He makes solving and explaining every problem way harder than it needs to be and never clearly outlines the steps. His tests are way harder than the homework and there is a 'learning tool' a.k.a. a quiz everyday in class. STAY AWAY! You'll regret taking this class and you don't even get credit for it.,1,
"Mr. was always willing to help, he just requires you put in the work. I was never a fan of math until I took his class. You can ask him fifty questions and he will do his best to answer you. Depending on the class he does lots of assignments or little quizes. I would highly recommend him. Attendance is not required but helps a lot!",1,
"Taught as if we already knew what he was teaching. Did not notice when the class was really confused. Very nice guy, total geek which made him so likeable.",0,
"I only went to class the first day and the days of the tests and passed. It is possible to not attend and pass if you just look in the book and practice a few problems before the tests. After all, attendance is not taken and you get no credits for taking math 102.",1,
"This guy is genuinely there for his students and is willing to help. I ended the class with 101% in the class, so getting an A isn't an impossible feat.. I suggest doing the all assignments, the study guides, and getting Calc. for dummies, which was a HUGE help for me. DON'T GET THE TEXTBOOK, I NEVER USED IT. PRACTICALLY WORTHLESS.",1,
"The class is difficult, so you will not pass by just attending class and expecting to absorb the information. If you don't put in effort outside of class then you are preparing to fail. He is sometimes hard to follow, but he offers many opportunities to seek help, and he cares about his students. Even though he is goofy, he's a really good guy.",1,
He wonders off subject more than he teaches and he tries to drag on and over explain things that we already know about.,0,
I think that the people going on here and posting good things about this class is himself. As a senior I was just looking at what people are saying about the worst professor ever here at UND. I had a horrible time in this class and I would never want anyone to have to take a class with him. He should never be allowed to teach here.,0,
Mr. is one of my least favorite professors. The problems he shows us in class are completely different from the web-assigns. This whole semester I have been teaching myself how to do everything. Would not recommend!!!,0,
"He might not be the clearest lecturer in the world but he is the absolute BEST one-on-one teacher I had in my four years at UND. He's so encouraging and genuinely wants his students to do well. If you're not willing to spend time on the homework & go to his office hours then you probably won't get a good grade, but that's your own fault.",1,
"Hardest class I've ever taken. Web assign assignments took me hours to complete because I had to teach myself the stuff that he was supposed to teach me. Boring lectures and hard tests. His favorite saying is 'math on!' so just from that you can imagine that he is a complete nerd, although he is nice.",0,
"Literally the worst. Funny/dry humor, but he will not work with you.",0,
"Extremely difficult class, but a requirement. That being said, even with all the bad reviews he knows what he's doing. His classes are difficult to follow and I wouldnt have passed with just attendance. He was available whenever I needed to ask him questions, and once responded to an email of mine at 4:30am. Dont know if I would pass without him",1,
The review sheets he gives you before hand are much easier than the questions on the test. You will think you are prepared and then you'll get stumped by trick questions.,1,
"Mr is a really nice guy but he is a very hard teacher. He takes the majority of class time showing you how to get a FORMULA. then there is only a short time to learn how to use the actual formula. I got A's on all my maths tests in highschool, out of four this year i got one B and the rest are lower then that. good luckk.",1,
Very Helpful and Easy to get help from. Tests are kind of hard but he gives you review sheets. Overall good teacher,1,
"He is the absolute worst teacher that I have ever had. The lectures are very confusing, but the homework is pretty easy. The stuff on the homework is no where to be found on the tests and when you get the test it seems like its all totally new information. He is very nice and willing to help, but it doesn't make up for how bad of a teacher he is",1,
Well... All I can say I that I showed up to every one of this guys class and I still somehow pulled a C out of nowhere... Thinks he is funny and tests are hard.. In class work has nothing to do with Web Assign homework.... GOOD LUCK,0,
"He's so sweet, but not a professor I would recommend. You will never, ever use the book, so don't buy it. His exams are basically trick questions from all the sections, and he's looking for perfection. He's a hard grader and in my opinion, unfair.",1,
"AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID. (Applied Calc. 146) He is a nice guy overall, but is an absolutely terrible professor. His lectures are almost useless for the homework assignments,and his tests seem to be completely random things that are not covered well in class or the study guides. Plus, he grades very hard.",0,
He is a nice guy. The problem is what he goes over in class and then what the assignments look like are two different things. If you don't want to be frustrated and feeling lost all the time avoid him at all cost's,0,
He is a very nice guy. Alot of people do not like him because of his grading but if you go in for help he will help you! Also the online homework is very easy and will help. He is a very nice man!,1,
"This guy lectures well but he is so soft spoken that it is imperative to sit right in front to hear him properly. The online homework took me a long time since I was new to Calculus, but it is the best way to learn the material. At one point he provided evidence to support Noah's flood and Earth's age which was a misuse of his position.",1,
"He tries to crack jokes during class form time to time, some funny some others not so. His notes are a little random and not so in-depth, but he is very willing to work with you in and out side of class! Don't be afraid to ask questions!!! His tests can be easy if you study and they are not take home tests!",1,
Dorky at times but a good teacher,0,
"He was a nice enough guy, but that gets you nowhere with teaching. His lectures are all over the place and do not relate to the online assignments at all. His lectures are scattered, covering things randomly and unevenly, and he goes through material way too fast. I would not recommend him as a teacher.",1,
"I get an absolute kick out of this guy in class! He has such a weird sense of humor, but it is still funny as heck! But on another note, he isn't really that good of a teacher. Doesn't do examples in class that help with homework, and pretty much told us that we will not need our book at all, which sucks because of how much the book costs. =/",0,
Lectures had nothing to do with the online assignments. Notes were not helpful at all. Basically taking a class with no teacher. Probably better off just trying to learn from the book and skipping class. Switched sections after week and a half,0,
"I've only been in his class for a week and I hate it! I used to love going to math class he just makes it frustrating! Lectures have nothing to do with online assignments, his notes don't even make sense, and he doesn't put any examples into action so your always clueless! Goes through things way to fast as well! Waste of my hard earned money!",0,
"I really like him as a person, but not as a teacher. His lectures were a lot different than the homework and the notes weren't very useful. He is hard to follow, but he will make time outside of class if extra help is needed.",1,
"He is a really nice guy and is willing to answer any questions, but he is terrible at teaching lectures!! The reason why I always needed to ask for help is because he would never really show how to do the problems. He went way too fast, even though he says he'll slow it down until people understand. Very frustrating!!",1,
"While he was very enthusiastic about Math, (which I appreciated), he was also very insistent that everyone understood everything quickly, without time to really practice what we had just learned. Disappointing when he knew over half of the class was going to fail, then didn't bother to help.",1,
"Horrible, he explains math and compares it to Star Wars. Tries to explain things too fast and he is just not understandable.",0,
Very hard to understand. Would NOT reccomend him unless you are good at teaching yourself. I went to class everyday and still did not understand it because he does not teach good.,0,
"I thought Mr. was an excellent PreCalculus instructor. One of the best math teachers I've had. He does a great job at explaining the concepts and providing examples on the blackboard. Also, I thought he was mildly entertaining and has a friendly demeanor, which never hurts.",1,
Wonderful teacher in office hours but terrible in class. I believe the chalk board learned more than anyone in the class.,1,
"HE TRYS HARD TO HELP AND TEACH US, BUT. HIS WAY OF EXPAINING THINGS IS,..... UNCLEAR AND HARD TO FOLLOW. I BELIVE THE ONLY WAY TO UNDERSTAND MR. IS TO HAVE PREVIOUSLY TAKEN THIS CLASS WITH A DIFFRENT PROFESSOR",1,
"cannot get his point across, is very confusing, puts all the trick questions on the tests and makes it difficult for students.Would not recommended him to any one.",0,
He is very helpful if you don't understand the topic. Sometimes the tests can be tricky but if you go in for his office hours he is more than happy to explain the concepts for you.,1,
TERRIBLE. Absolutley hated his class. He just assumes everyone understands the information and never asks if you actually get it or not. Also he moves really fast through the material which can be a bad thing when he sucks at teaching it.,0,
Avoid! At the start of the semester I looked at this site on him and it was a 1.9 I didn't think much of it I figured just as long as I show up to class and do the work I will do fine. Well I did all of that and I studied many many hours before tests and it never paid off. What Im trying to say is that he makes the class harder than it should be.,1,
"Along with everyone else, he's the worst teacher I have ever had. He pretty much just talks to himself the whole period and doesn't ask if anyone gets it. He sometimes talks to period marks on the board. The most awkward guy I know!",0,
"If you're looking to understand math, do not take it with him.",0,
i would give this teacher a .8,0,
Best math teacher I've ever had! Definitely taking one of his classes again.,0,
tests in his class are impossible.,0,
"Horrible teacher, I would never sign up for a class with this guy again",0,
"This guy is terrible he teaches the class harder than its supposed to be. Your better off paying the $600 bucks and taking it online. Do not take him at all. Trust me if you want to pass, he is not the guy. He just rambles on and doesn't stop to explain things. I highly advise you not to listen to the comments from nerds saying how good he is.",0,
"Best math teacher I've ever had. He's really helpful and accomodating. Hes also really easy to talk to, dont hesitate to go talk to him about problems on a test. If you go to class regularly, take notes and DO the homework, there is absolutly no reason you shouldnt get an A.",1,
Terrible teacher. I will not ever take a class from him again. his grading is so unfair. dont ever think you can take a class and get a grade you deserve from him,0,
worst teacher ever. i took this class before. i know everything we go over. i teach about 10 other students in the class cause they don't know whats going on yet when the test come around. impossible. the average test grades for the class are 61%,0,
I would not wish this teacher on anyone!,0,
Worst teacher I have ever had! He cannot teach whatsoever and his grading is really unfair. If you are signed up for his class switch to someone else asap.,0,
for those who struggle at all with math...dont take a class from farm. He teaches by showing the most complicated problem first then works backward...very difficult to learn anything from his lectures.,,
"Worst teacher I have ever had my whole entire life!He cant teach at all.I went in for extra help,which was the most useless wasted hours of my life.His tests are rediculous-no partial credit given.You either get the 5 points or you get none. How can a question be worth 5 points, and if you get it wrong, you get none&#63;Where do the 5 points come from&#63;",,
"Farm wasn't that bad...VERY easy to talk to...yes test were hard, but speak up! if you say something he will try and fix it...he fixed 2 tests we had because we expressed concern...he really does want to work with you...",,
No Comments,,
"Although nice, and somewhat approachable, his teaching methods are very hard to learn from. He also gives extremely long and hard exams, which most of the class fails. The class average four our first exam was an F. I would not recommend this class for anyone who wants a good grade, or has a hard time teaching themselves math.",,
I don't see why everyone has such a problem with him. I like his teaching style and you learn quite a bit from it. Take the class from him if you actually want to learn and not fall behind for the next Calc class. He's helpful and accomodating after class also..,,
No Comments,,
worst teacher ever he doesnt belong in eduaction,,
Do not take from farm im telling you its not good take it from champion or simmers,,
stuart is very hard to understand and his tests are also very hard. Do not take a class from him,,
Completely sucks. Avoid at all costs,,
the whole class failed the first test.. hes a great guy but his teaching method is not the best.. i hardly understood anything,,
Avoid this guy at all costs. I have taken several math classes in college and have never gotten below a B. I had to drop this class becuase I had an average of 40%. Extremely hard tests. He said his tests are a measure of real life therefore he dosen't curve. So does this mean that the average person is failing in life like they are on his tests&#63;,,
had him first sem. my freshman year and he was really hard. His method of teaching is hard to understand and I dislike having the whole grade based on tests.,,
No Comments,,
Took this class last year. Caught a mathematical error that he made that drastically changed the steps to take to solve the problem and the solution to the problem itself. He fought me on it regardless of substantially proving he was wrong. Next class period he taught it correctly how I had shown.,,
No Comments,,
"Absolutely Boring, not to mention wierd. Havn't taken a test yet but I assume I won't do well because his teaching methods suck.",,
terrible sucks at teaching very unhelpful,,
"Not a bad teacher, although I did not enjoy the lame jokes and teaching style. I never went to the class and passed, 102 being a pass fail class saved me. no need to attend class because he never gives pop quizes as long as you study hard on your own. I learned more through the book",,
"Mr. Farm keeps your interest with his funny gestures and wierd Math jokes. But, please, study real hard because if your class is in an auditorium of 100 people like mine was you will not learn as much.",,
"I would not consider this class a sociology class. This felt more like just information on drugs and did not talk about it sociologically. It was still a good class, a lot harder than any other class by Frank White. Online quizzes for every test which are easy. You cannot skip this class ever.",,
Great professor! Manages to entertain a whole lecture hall when he teaches. Hilarious and will always keep your attention.,,
"Frank's easily one of the best professors at UND and goes out of his way to get to know his students. Knows all the course content extremely well, and keeps you engaged the whole time. Some of his stories are awesome. Do the memory matrices, crosswords, and study guides and you'll easily pass. Go to class because his powerpoints are fill in.",,
"Frank is easily one of the most knowledgeable professors at UND. He's also incredibly likable and approachable, and his lectures are genuinely interesting.",,
"I've had two classes with Frank White and I honestly wish he taught more than just Sociology. He is always helpful, friendly, and personable. The world needs more Frank White and I'm willing to take any class he is teaching.",,
"Frank White is the BEST professor at UND. He can turn the most boring topic into something that you're literally on the edge of your seat to hear. He's extremely knowledgeable and up-to-date on his material, genuinely cares about his students, and takes the time to get to know them. He's got a great sense of humor and is well respected by everyone",,
"Great class, great teacher. He does use power points now. Either use your computer to fill in the notes or print out the power points and bring them to class to fill in the rest of the lecture notes.",,
"Interesting and entertaining. Instructor makes this class a pleasure and is very high energy. He was always willing to answer questions and provide assistance and was happy to have engaged students. Even if you aren't a SOC major, take this class!",,
"Funny, interesting, and helpful! Definitely recommend Dr. White! He gets to know his students (which is amazing that he knows so many in such a large lecture) and enjoys what he does!",,
"Frank is one of the best teachers at UND. It's sad that he's now done with the big lecture classes, because otherwise I'd highly recommend you take them. Intro to Soc. was extremely easy anyway, but he made going to class fun and that made the class awesome.",,
Most interesting prof. I've ever had. Even if you're not interested in the material his lectures will get you listening. Attendance is pretty much required with easy daily quizzes but it was honestly never a struggle to convince myself to go to this class. Definitely take at least one class from him.,,
He's such an awesome professor. He has passion for what he teaches and makes things interesting to us. He uses funny examples all the time that are sure to get a laugh out of you. I HIGHLY recommend taking this class from him.,,
"Frank is by far one of the best teachers at UND. Lectures are very entertaining, and he has a fun sense of humor and great story-telling ability. Posts online memory matrices, review information, and a lecture outline to guide students. Highly recommend taking the class.",,
Frank White was a great professor! I looked forward to going to class because Frank was funny and outgoing during lectures and passionate toward what he was teaching. The tests were not to bad as long as you went to class and studied for them.,,
"One of the best teachers i've ever had, all his classes are lecture based, he has a funny story for every topic he is talking about. Made coming to class fun. Highly recommended",,
"Such a great professor. He made and effort to get to know me personally. Also, he makes class very interesting. He talks about personal stories to help you understand the material.",,
"AMAZING professor. He is the reason I switched my major to Sociology. Always attend class because he does not put notes online. If you can, bring your laptop for notes. He jumps around a lot and fills in things he missed during his lecture so it's easiest to use your computer and he doesn't use powerpoint.",,
"Very interesting, has stories for everything. Doesn't use powerpoint which makes class much more interactive but make sure to take notes because most of the exam is based off of class. Best professor I've had at UND and very approachable",,
"He was a great professor! If you take the time to talk to him and get to know him it will benefit you in the end. Go to class though and pay attention, he doesn't put the notes online and he talks really fast! But overall he makes class interesting!",,
Frank is the best professor I've had. If you go to class and take the notes (he doesn't put them on powerpoint) it's an easy A. He tells funny stories and makes class really interesting.,,
Very entertaining. Keeps you engaged! He connects things to real world stuff so it's easy to understand which makes the tests easy!,,
EXCELLENT teacher. if you are taking sociology take it from him. He is very funny and entertaining. you have to attend class or you wont have the notes for the tests which are 70% off of lecture notes. the other 30% is from the book which you have to read. he gives a study guide which is very helpful.,,
"He is definitely the best professor I have had so far. He is really funny and personable and makes the class interesting. But, you need to go to class to get the notes because he doesnt put them up on blackboard and most of the test is based off lecture. Easy A if you go.",,
"helpful , made the class interesting",,
he is the best teacher I have had at UND so far. he loves his job and wants you to learn. there is never a bad lecture.,,
"Very passionate in his lecture, and likes to make the class laugh. he always talks to people before class starts just to see how their day is going. The only negative is that he does not use powerpoints so you have to write everything down. He talks very fast too, so either learn how to type/write quickly.",,
Good teacher but my only complaints are he doesnt use powerpoint slides or post notes on blackboard so you have to write down everything he says and he talks fast & rambles a lot.Make friends in the class because if you miss a day you will need to get the notes from them or else you won't do that well on the tests. Do the study guides as well.,,
"By far the best professor at UND. He is so passionate about his students and his career. Going to class was always a blast, and almost every seat was always filled.",,
lectures are very interesting and helpful in understanding textbook,,
Hilarious and very interesting! I love this class and White really knows his stuff. Every lecture is entertaining. Labs are pointless though,,
THIS GUY IS HILARIOUS AND DEFINATELY KNOWS WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT. BY FAR THE BEST SOCIOLOGY TEACHER AND IS VERY EASY AND FUN TO LISTEN TO,,
I had this guy for a professor some years ago and I remember him doing a fantastic job. His lectures were smooth and fast moving as he demonstrated an outstanding grasp of the material. Easily one of the top three professors I've encountered in my college time.,,
AWESOME LECTURER! totally hilarious and keeps your attention guaranteed. His classes are kind of random facts thrown together but review sheets help extremely on tests. TA's are either awesome or insanely stuck up.... so beware. Lab homework is tedious but very easy.,,
One of the best professors at UND. His lectures are humorous; not boring or &quot;death by power point.&quot;,,
"Far and away the best Prof at UND. Funny as hell, great teacher, and cares for his students. Sometimes his class is like watching a stand-up comic. Take any class you can, you will not regret it.",,
Frank's lectures are very interesting and they are also very easy to understand. He also makes learning easy by connecting stories to his lectures.,,
"AWESOME teacher. Very dynamic and makes the class very interesting. I would take another class I don't find interesting at all, as long as he teaches it because he's such a great teacher.",,
Such a funny class! Cant get over the accent. His stories are so damn funny and they help you relate real life with the course teachings. Take anything with this teacher,,
"Frank is easily the best teacher I've had in my 3 years of college. He really does seem to enjoy teaching and seems like a very genuinely caring guy. Anyone looking to take this course, rest assured that you have an excellent professor in charge. Again, one of the best teachers UND has.",,
A UND &quot;legend&quot;. It's tough to get into his Intro class but worth the wait. He's a great prof.,,

"This is the funnest ****ing professor ever. I went to the class just for fun, I wasn't even enrolled in it. (And it was the only class I went to during my 3 semesters at UND)",,
"Frank has a way with the students, he is not just there because thats what he is suppose to do but I believe that he has passion in what he does which brings excitement to his class. Love the stories, they help me relate, when I study for his class it is so much easier when I have the stories to remember and fall back on.",,
"frank white is my favorite professor, his attitude and energy is amazing. his class is one of the only classes i look forward too.",,
He is a great teacher. He relates what hes talking to real life so you can understand it better.,,

Loved his stories and films. Fun class. Learned lots.,,
Great teacher all around!,,
"Very lousy teacher. His stories rambled and were annoying. He could have crammed what took him and hour to say into 30 seconds. I stopped going after the first 3 weeks, and still pulled an A. I guess he wasn't really needed. They should get rid of him.",,
"Awesome teacher. He's one of the few teachers whose lectures I can actually pay attention to. I'll go into the class dog tired but come out completely energized. Very funny, knowledgeable guy.",,
"very good teacher loved the stories, i think he is one of the best on campus",,
Made the class very interesting. Loved his stories!,,
one of the best lecturers I have ever seen.,,
Shares applicable stories in class to relate to material. . .entertaining!!,,
"This has by far been the hardest thing I have ever done in my life but it is SO worth it. The class is time consuming and a good grade doesn't come easy. You have to be determined and have to put a lot of time and effort into the course, but Dr. Shively isn't out to make people fail, he wants you to pass, you just have to READ the Q's.",,
"Shively is the man. He really knows his stuff. This class with the lab was easily the hardest course I've ever taken. If you aren't constantly reading the chapters, spending a couple of nights a week in lab you're not going to get an A. That being said it is possible. Super funny guy, really cares about his students, but he'll make you work for it.",,
"Dr. Shively is the best professor I've ever had. He helped me to UNDERSTAND and LOVE the material rather than just memorize it. He is willing to work with you outside of class and he cares about your success. This course is the tough and requires a lot of effort. But if you are willing to work REALLY hard and put in the hours, an A is possible!",,
"His tests suck! They are super unclear and you end up trying to read his mind. 'How many straight sections of the colon?' Could be 2 or 3 depending on his thoughts. He is a veterinary science guy, not an intro to anatomy. He might be better at higher level anatomy classes, but not for an intro class. He likes to show off how smart he is.",,
"If you have to take Anatomy, take it from Shively! He's honestly the best lecture teacher available. He has funny stories he'll tell and he loves it when students ask questions. This is a very hard class but I could tell Shively wanted his students to succeed, he just expects you to use your brain and actually do the work and reading!!",,
"The amount of work and time spent needed to even pass, and probably for the second go around, is not equal to the 4 credits earned. Take Anatomy somewhere else! Many students take all other needed classes and then transfer to BYU or SLCC to take Anatomy to keep their good GPA to be accepted to the desired program.",,
"I enjoyed Dr Shively, but this class is a little ridiculous. The anatomy department acts like their class is a gift from the gods. I am in nursing school now and am annoyed that the correct anatomical terms I spent so much time learning in this class aren't used in the medical field - I have to learn the 'improper' terms used in the real world.",,
"This teacher is horrible. His lectures don't really help with what you need to know in order to get a good grade. His tests are made to make you fail. I went to class every time, studied my butt off, and talked to him about what I can do to get a better grade and still didn't succeed.",,
"Definitely not the greatest teacher. Rude and was bad at teaching the subject, you'll learn more from the textbook than him.",,
Memorize the entire textbook. Even then the questions on the test are obscure. I would say not to take too many credits while taking this class. Usually the labs are supplements to the lecture but in the lab you also have to memorize the other textbook. Even if you take from an easier teacher all the anatomy courses are structured the same.,,
His tests for the intro to anatomy and physiology class were ridiculously hard. He gives you a study guide but that doesn't really help you. His multiple choice tests are A-F sometimes A-J. After the second test with a class average of 50% or lower it really discouraged people to even try. His questions are tricky and sometimes out of context.,,
"Shively taught me so much, I am so grateful I took his class. When students didn't understand, he explained the material another way. Memorize the textbook!!! He will try to help you succeed as long as you want it enough to keep trying. There is a lot of material, but I passed even though I had a concussion this semester. You can do it!",,
"Dr. Shively is the best professor I've ever had. His class is almost impossibly hard, but he designs it that way on purpose. If you go to him for help, he won't just 'help you out' by giving you good grades, but he will do everything he can to help you really learn anatomy. He's also one of the kindest and most hilarious people I've ever met.",,
"Like everyone else on here has said, Shively's class is HARD. He knows everything there is to know about Anatomy, and nearly expects you to also in a very short amount of time. You HAVE to go to class, and should study every day, use every resource available. The curve saved me in his class, thankfully. But seriously, be prepared to study HARD.",,
"UVU offers a mind-reading class, it should be a prerequisite for taking any class from Shively. He's an arrogant man who uses his classes to prove how smart he is, not as a way to educate students. The labs are awesome and the lab staff but Shively's direction of the class, lectures and attitude are beyond ridiculous.",,
"Dr. Shively is hilarious and I honestly loved his class. However it was seriously one of the hardest things I've ever done (because of the course material, not the teacher). Lots of reading, and the tests were very tricky (but the whole anatomy department uses the same tests). The expected averages were in the 50's and 60's (the curve is magical).",,
"Dr. Shively is a character. That being said, he really wants his students to succeed. He is a kind-hearted person and really knows his material. Be prepared to study a lot. His online videos are extremely helpful. Totally possible to earn an A but you will work hard.",,
"2325 too. This has been by far the hardest class I've taken, but I'm glad I took it from Shively because I have learned SO much and I've enjoyed learning it all. He is a nice guy and always answers my questions. It's a hard class but it needs to be. If you're not good at spelling, get good at it before taking this class from anyone at UVU.",,
Dr. Shively is a great teacher. He has lectures that he has filmed that are available online. They were extremely helpful. I liked that he broke things down in a simple way so I could understand. His tests were really hard. He will tell u whats on the test. The learning objectives packet will be your saving grace when it comes to studying.,,
He just has a memorized lecture and gives it the same every time. If you ask questions he is rude and you can't read his hand writing or the board in Pope science buliding . He acts if using a projector would kill him. If you can't see the board that is a problem!! also he doesn't do what he says he is going to do!! BAD!,,
"Exceptionally smart, very high expectations. Sometimes it felt like he had a hard time bringing his level of knowledge down to us just learning Anatomy. Don't even think about skipping class. Read like your life depends on it. He adjusts at the end of the semester, try your best to stay above the class average, which is surprisingly hard to do...",,
"Dr. Shively is a hilarious genius, but in my opinion, not the best teacher. I enjoyed going to class for the sole purpose of observing his personality, but most of the time I spent wondering what I was paying for. He wrote the book on anatomy (literally) and if you take this class at UVU, your ONLY option is to know it inside and out. GOOD LUCK!",,
"Dr. Shively is not a teacher--he's a lecturer. Don't go to class expecting him to teach you new material. He's expecting you to show up already knowing the material, and then you can talk about it during class. He's a great guy and super hilarious. Much more approachable than Don, although Don is a better 'teacher'. I re-toke this class from Don.",,
"Soooooo read the chapter, but like 100 times. His test questions are just worded weird... and it doesnt help when he writes the freaking tests in his cursive handwriting..... he doesnt test you on the obvious, but tests you on things you might skip or pass up. Read all small print under pictures. Understand how all terms and concepts work together.",,
"It's actually a 9 hour a week class that you only get 4 credit hours for (3 in lecture + 1 in testing center + 3 in lab + 2 in open lab required for STA to sign off on your hw 9 hrs). If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea don't take it. The students who pass this class plan ahead and don't take a full semester load, the rest fail.",,
"Yes, the tests are hard, it's a lot of work, but it's the most rewarding class ever. Shively is GREAT in lecture because he gives you simple definitions. The best textbook I've ever had. Grading is rough, but you'll understand why. He lets you know what you do need to know and in how much detail. He comes off scary but he's hilarious & very sweet.",,
"Doesn't care if students are successful, only wants to show everybody how smart he is. Class was a waste of time, and tests had trick questions so even if you know the material you have to know how he thinks to get correct answers. Bad experience, he is giving UVU a bad rep. This instructor is not teaching to help the students succeed, bad instruct",,
"Dr. Shively takes pleasure in having the most ridiculously difficult class on campus, this class should be worth 12 credit hours at least. I got an A, so I am not just a jaded student who got his GPA wrecked. His giant ego is second only to that of his minion TA's who love to scare current students to death. Switch Universities before taking this.",,
"I hated this class! Shively has a LOT of knowledge on the subject, which is great but without recording the class or having a photographic memory there is no way you will pass. His tests are ridiculously tricky and you basically just have to guess. Oh wait even if you do he will mark you wrong on every test.... EVEN If you are right!",,
"Awesome class! Prepares you well for med school. Those who bag on this class obviously don't try hard enough to pass. Shively was a great professor, so funny and willing to help you out and clarify concepts. Such a great class, lab was so fun!",,
"Shively was a really good teacher, but his tests were brutal. He changed his style of tests constantly, which meant a surprise.",,
Very difficult class. Shively know what he's talking about and teaches to show off his knowledge. Tests are incredibly hard and very tricky. He doesn't test your knowledge - he tests your guessing ability.,,
Shively and his minions (lab instructors and STA's) are more interested in furthering their ego than teaching. Worst educators I've ever experienced. This entire class was a complete waste of time and money. Take from another University if you don't want to ruin your GPA or plan on getting into graduate school.,,
"Shively's Intro to Anatomy class kinda felt more like an Intro Med School class. People on here are not kidding when they say it's difficult! You NEED the textbook to pass. All I can say is STUDY STUDY STUDY. If you do poorly on one test (of his five or so) he will let you replace one with the final. Go to class, read your notes, read the text.",,
Shively is a nice guy but is not very organized or structured. You pretty much just show up to class to ask him questions. Just ready the book thoroughly and memorize the objectives. Very time consuming class and tests and final are difficult.,,
"Shively is a unique fellow. I like him. He knows what he's talking about. He wrote the book on anatomy, literally. The textbook anyway. The subject is tough, there is a lot to learn. He won't dumb it down, so if you're not putting in enough effort you won't pass the class. Shively does do his best to motivate his students and help them understand",,
"Michael Shively seems to know a great deal about the study of Anatomy. This being said, he is the worst professor I have ever encountered. He was frequently absent throughout the course. Additionally, he would often respond to student inquiries very rudely. The lectures are useless and the tests are unjustifiably difficult.",,
"Difficult class. It takes a lot of time and effort. One of the most rewarding classes I have ever taken. If you enjoy learning, you will love this class. If you want an easy 'A' don't take it.",,
"In this class you have to ATTEND. STUDY. And STUDY some more. Yes it is very difficult, but very rewarding. Wonderful teacher, and is always willing to help.",,
"Difficult class. Takes a lot of time and effort. (40+ hours a week) It has been one of the most rewarding classes ever taken. If you have any questions, all you need to do is ask. Also he is willing to meet with you if you contact him and set an appointment.",,
Shively is an awesome guy but gives tests from hell. They are extremely difficult if you don't plan on making anatomy your life then I would recommend taking this class somewhere else.,,
"Take from somewhere else. You will tear your hair out at the amount of work and time you will spend. I lived in the lab and studied like crazy, but did not pass. The tests are a huge downfall. You will not regret taking it from another university.",,
"If you do not have a job, and all you do is school, this class may be slightly easier for you. But it would be a lie to say he is a good teacher, or grades fairly. The study guides, and going to class contained maybe 10% of what is actually on the tests. The average test scores are around 35%.",,
Great teacher! Dr. Shively is legit! He says exactly what he means and follows through. He tells you exactly what you need to do in order to succeed. DO IT! Read the book. DO THE OBJECTIVES! Read the clinicals. Yeah it's hard. So make sure you work hard! Don't under estimate this class but it will be the best class if you put in the work required.,,
"Shively is a good lecturer in that what he says is engaging and interesting to learn. His tests though are horrendous. He does exactly what they say not to do when giving a test, and makes it so that everyone fails. This is just the intro. class, yet it felt like the real thing minus the lab. Do not take this class!",,
Best teacher for subject of anatomy. Always willing to help and explain subject matter. If you do the required work you will succeed .,,
"Let me set the record straight: You will be fine in this class if you DO THE OBJECTIVES, STUDY THE REVIEW QUESTIONS, AND DO STUDY THE OUTLINE IN THE BOOK. It's hard material,but Shively does a great job of helping you understand, but you need to study the book! He'll help you if you work hard. You'll love the class if you do!",,
"Dr. Shively knows all about anatomy, but he's not a good teacher. His lectures consist of him making crude jokes, and making a point that he's smarter than the students. His tests consist of tricky questions, and he prides himself on low class averages. It's possible to get an A, you just have to dedicate your life to it and memorize the book.",,
Shively knows anatomy. He's the best there is as far as that goes. But he wears terrible scores as a badge of honor. This means that his tests are very difficult and designed to be tricky. He wants his students to dedicate their lives to his class and you'll need to do just that in order to get an A. Toughest class I've ever had.,,
"I knew going in that this would be hard but this was insane. Dr. Shively is a really nice guy, and he went out of his way to help me out. That said, he has an ego the size of the school and it seems like he is proud of the fact that his is the hardest class on campus. He makes it TOO hard. Beware nursing students, he doesn't care much for you.",,
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS,If you plan on having a life outside of anatomy! If you want to do well, plan on committing to 12 hours a week for both lab and lecture. Shively and his minions delight in making students feel dumb, and sucking up all their time. Don't feed the beast; take this course somewhere else!",,
Doctor Shively is an amazing professor. The best I have had at UVU. Anatomy is a very hard class but Doc makes it clear what you need to know. Very clear and wants students to succeed and learn. His tests are difficult but ultimately really help you learn. Overall I really enjoyed this class although it was extremely hard.,,
Don't believe the hype. The monster grade curve will atone for all your mistakes as long as you give your best. There's NO reason to fail this class or take it twice. DOn't beleive it. Find a good study crew and work hard.,,
"As an introductory course, particularly for a student not in pursuit of a medical career, this class was very distressing. I read the reviews here before taking this class and had a 'can do it' attitude but in retrospect I am asking, 'Why did I do that to myself?' The class average was around 40% on tests! Stressful...",,
"Took this class and studied my butt off..of course to no avail. I am convinced that he finds pleasure in knowing people struggle and fail. I would not take another Anatomy course from UVU. I have come to hate Anatomy and after taking Homan's 2320, I changed my major.",,
Shively is awesome! Hands-down the best class I have ever taken. Super helpful and kind. Knows everything about the subject. Willing to help outside of class or answer any question without making you feel dumb. Work hard-get a good study partner. Study exactly what he tells you from the book. An A is totally possible!!,,
"Dr. Shively is AWESOME!! Hands-down the best class I have ever taken. Requires A LOT to get an A, but it's worth it. Study exactly what he says-don't just memorize-understand it well enough to explain it to someone else. Get a good study partner and work like you've never worked and you'll get SO much out of it. One complaint-doesn't use Canvas!",,
"HORRIBLE teacher! I took this class via TV, so I was able to watch and rewatch the lectures. I took notes, attended every lecture, etc. The tests had very few things from class on them. I felt that attending class was pointless, because he went over things that weren't even kind of on the test. I felt like he was just trying to weed people out.",,
"People whine and moan about this class, but that's because you have to WORK HARD in this class, and people are not committed, or they are too lazy. This class has been accused of many things, but understand this: It is the most rewarding class you will ever take, and will prepare you for your medical career, hands down.",,
"NEVER EVER TAKE ANATOMY WITH Shively!! He plays guitar, but it doesn't apply to anatomy! In my opinion, he makes fun of the students and probably just wants money and business. The tests and the requirements that he pushed students to take are ridiculous!",,
This was the hardest and the most rewarding class you will ever take. You can practically applied the material taught in class into reality. Be motivated and dedicated to this class and an A is possible. If you work for it you can get it. Must love to read to understand to survive this class.,,
HARDEST class I have ever LOVED. Be 110% committed and you will get an A. Dr. Shively is more than willing to help if you just ask!,,
good teacher but the hardest class you will take,,
"This class is not an easy class. Shively expects more than just memorization. He wants students to think critically about the material. Once you realize he expects more than memorization, it makes the class more bearable and interesting. He's a good instructor, though not the most helpful one on one.",,
"HArdest class you will ever take... That being said, also the most rewarding. Shively is the man! Great teacher, definetely teaches you to think things through. Combo of him and homan was best learning experience I have had at uvu. Dedicate EVERYTHING to this class, and an A is possible",,
Shively's Anatomy is about the hardest class you can take at UVU. He is very good at explaining things and knows almost everything about the subject. His tests are very difficult due to the wording of his questions and the vast amount of information you need to know. He is willing to help if asked. If you want to know the subject well take it here.,,
"Shively is a nice guy but as a teacher he is misguided. He seems to have something against the health field (specifically nurses). Anyways, his tests are unclear with sometimes more than one answer possible but you have to pick Shively's choice. I got an A in the class (precurve) but regret taking the course with Shively - take it somewhere else",,
"Shively is actually an awesome teacher, but demanding. Study what he tells you to, but know it backwards and forwards. Questions are tricky. I earned an A w/o curve. I know from friends grades that the curve is very generous. This was my only class and I wasn't working, so it was my life. It was hard, but I feel prepared for PA school.",,
"If you've heard this is the hardest class you will take, you're right! But it will be the most rewarding class you will ever take. I'm in nursing school right now, and thanks to Shively i know my stuff forward and backward. I got an A with the curve but i dedicated my life to Anatomy! Good Luck, but be prepared to eat, sleep, breath Anatomy!",,
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS FROM SHIVELY. His quizzes/midterm/final are ridiculous. He seems to get some kind of entertainment by seeing students squirm and struggle. Says certain things will be or won't be tested on and it was always he opposite. You have a better chance of doing well if you take Homan, or take it at BYU and live to tell the story!",,
"The trio of professors; Shively, Holman, and Bracken, shaped my love for human science. I am now a biomed engineering student which requires a rigorous attention to detail. Bracken helped teach how to think. Shively underlined the importance of being meticulous. Holman instilled passion and taught me that med school is not the answer to everything",,
Shively is a brilliant man... unfortunately he likes to wave that brilliance in students faces with the types of questions he asks on tests. Honestly the worst test giver i have ever heard of. if you take this class be ready to work your butt off and not score well. lab is great lecture is ridiculous.,,
If you have the choice... GET HOMAN. shively is funny but his tests and quizzes are ridiculous,,
"Dr. Shively has taught for so long that his lectures seem to be memorized, so everything on the tests is mentioned in class. However, that does not mean they are easy at all. The average was in the 30s. You will learn a lot, and if you study you should do fine. In a way his class tests more on ability to answer trick questions than on knowledge.",,
"Read the book extensively. Obj's, Q's @ back of book, and ask things in class. Well above avg on quizzes, C on final and got A. Dr. Shively is demanding, but thorough and kind. DO xtra credit!",,
"This class is the hardest class that I have taken in college. It is available to those who are just trying to get their generals done but this class is so in depth that unless you are going into the medical field, DON'T DO IT! If you are just getting your Associates, take another class!!",,
I took his online course and it was awful. He offered us ZERO assistance and did not respond to one single email all semester. I think it's unfair we can't review our exams to see what we missed and why. He is harsh in his grading and likes to trick you on the quizzes and exams. The high in our class was a 62% so he graded on a curve.,,
"Dr. Shively is amazing! The class is hard, but you get a lot out of it. I am hoping for an amazing curve so I can pass. Best day ever when he plays the guitar. He is laid back, easily approachable, just pay attention in class and don't chat. Get to know him, he is amazing! The class is really hard, but it will prepare you for an awesome career.",,
"Exacting and challenging course. Avg quiz score 72%, studied like a religion, Dr. Shively is warm and helpful. This class taught me I can do anything. HARD but thorough.",,
"Take this class elsewhere if you must have A. Shively good, nice person, but tests unreasonable..asks &#63; not in text of lec book. I studied 50 hrs a wk and would get 55 avg...was prior A student in classes like gen chem/science at UVU. If you must take at UVU, take from Homan. He seems gruff, but not and tests actually from text of lecture book.",,
"It's been a few yrs since I took this class, but b/c of this man I aced my med school Anatomy class. All the rumors that this is the hardest class you'll ever take are completely true. But that being said, med school anatomy was a cake walk after going through this class! So if you really planning on going into medicine, this is the class to take.",,
"Dr. Shively is an excellent teacher- the fact that he and prof. Homan wrote their own books shows their commitment to their profession. He is extremely knowledgeable and does a great job at pushing his students to truly think of solutions that we may face in our future. Overall, read the book, do the practice questions- and learn how he asks Q's.",,
One of my faviorite teachers at UVU. I enjoyed his class even though it was difficult. Very helpful if you ask and make sure you take time to meet with him.,,
"VERY possible to do well in this class. Those who are complaining either don't know how to study or didn't put in enough time. The info is straightforward there's just a lot to learn. Doc will answer any question you have. Spent over an hour with me outside class answering questions. If your'e going into the medical field, take this class at UVU.",,
"Many hate Dr. Shively but I really like him and the tests teach you to actually think. All tests from other teachers are a cinch after this. Work hard, don't fall behind or you'll never catch up. Expect to have no social life, live in the lab, read the text, always go to class, get into study groups! Read text before class and ask questions.",,
"The anatomy class was a complete joke, he puts these bogus statistics all over the classroom, A;s B;s C;s etc completely false, we actual corresponded with each other during summer check with each others grades completely bogus, They have been trying to get rid of him for a while, Homan is worse.",,
"To start off with, many people have succeeded with A's and B's in this course, even first timers. For Lab, show up, quiz others, quiz yourself, point things out, utilize STAs. For Lecture, go through outline, read chapter, and quiz yourself. Shively will help you out, he will hold study sessions for questions. Write them down, think, and ask him.",,
"Difficult teacher. Difficult subject. This class seemed better suited for Med school rather than UVU. The curves aren't bad. I got C's on the midterm and final and got an A- overall. You will study your butt off, and get used to late nights, but it's possible to pass.",,
I was a straight A student. I studied every day. Once a week I stayed up ALL night studying. I got a B-. There was just too much material to cover and the lecture quizes are tricky even if &quot;Mr.&quot; shively disagrees. I'm embarrassed that I worked so hard and did so poorly. Thank you Mr. Shively,,
"How well you do in this class is a big indicator of what kind of person you are. If you procrastinate, don't have basic study discipline, and if you just go through the motions--you will hate this professor, because he actually expects you to do something called work. Welcome to college.",,
"Dr. Shively is smart, and his class (and tests) are HARD but you probably already heard. He's a good teacher who knows his stuff, buckle down and learn how to study or wuss out and go somewhere else for this class. My favorite day was when he brought in his guitar.",,
I worked very hard in this class. It required a lot of work for being an Intro class but felt like a higher level class. His tests were very tricky. I didn't like how he would ramble on and you didn't know what to study. Find a different professor!,,
"This class is the hardest thing I have ever done. You will study the text till you can no longer read. But I don't regret it. If you put in the time to study for each quiz, you will learn the material. The tests are tricky because of the wording, so watch yourself and learn his tricks. Don't take this class somewhere else if you want to be medical.",,
This teacher requires A LOT of your attention. He is a great teacher and knows his stuff really well. I enjoyed the class but you will have to dedicate almost all of your time to this class!,,
"At the end of this class you will have mastered critical thing as well as anatomy. His tests and quizzes are the hardest I've taken, but you really know the stuff. IF you want to be good at your profession, take anatomy at UVU, if you just want to get a good grade then take it at slcc, and please don't be my doctor! In all, I do love anatomy now.",,
"One of my favorite professors, his classes are tough, so no easy grade. I think if you really try you will find he has a lot to offer as an instructor.",,
"Shively is the funniest professor I've ever had. He's excellent at explaining all the concepts clearly. His quizzes and tests are insanely hard, but he grades on a curve so it's easy to get a good grade. My only complaint is that I had no idea what my grade was til after the course ended. But anyone who says stay away just didn't work hard enough.",,
LITERALLY JUST STAY AWAY. TAKE IT FROM ANOTHER SCHOOL. I have always been a straight A student. I recieved a C+ in this class. I spent an average of 20+ hours in the lab a week and ten hours studying the lecture book. RUN AWAY NOW. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME..,,
I don't even know where to begin. The quizzes and tests are so ridiculous. Studying does no good whatsoever. Usually the class average on a quiz is around 35-50%. Shively is definately better than the other teachers. This class is literally a joke.,,
"Dr. Shivley knows his stuff and helps you learn it as well, but when it comes to the tests you have a better chance of doing well if you dont even study. His quizzes are by far the most tricky I have ever seen. And the most difficult. Anatomy is a great class and Shivley is a good teacher but be prepared to work your butt of and to have NO LIFE oth",,
"This is a VERY hard class. Definitely not an easy a. Shively is a hilarious teacher and explains things well. Of all the anatomy teachers, he's the best!",,
"I took the Zool 1090 class on line, and quite frankly it was completely unorganized and unprofessional. The downloads for the course rarely worked, so I would highly recommend just renting the dvd's. The dvd's were informative and Dr. Shively is definitely an intelligent man, however it was impossible to contact him. The course was horrible.",,
"this is an intense class, but you will learn your stuff. Treat this class like a full time job. Dr Shivley is brillent! he makes the best analogies, it really helped me in understanding certain processes. I highly highly recommend this professor!",,
"The expectations for this class are unreal. The test questions are very hard, & test you on how well you read them rather than the material. His lectures don't really prepare you, but the material in the textbook does. That being said, Dr. Shively is an extremely nice & helpful man. I would definitely recommend him over other lecture instructors.",,
Very intelligent guy and knows his stuff well! Be sure to keep up in the reading and his study guide that he gives out and ask a lot of questions. Also ALWAYS check the answers you got wrong on quizzes. Sometimes there were things on the quiz that I had never heard of so it is good to go back and clarify with him. He also grades on a curve.,,

"Just about everything in lecture is right out of the textbook. Tests are extremely hard and tricky. He's not interested in teaching, just interested in complete memorization of his 1000 page text. Doesn't want right answers, want his answers. I would take this class at another university.",,
"Dr Shively is great. His tests are ridiculously hard, but you learn a lot. READ THE TEXT! I went to class everyday, but a lot of what he teaches is in the text and a good chunk of what he doesn't! Know the questions at the end of the chapter! Draw the pictures he draws in lecture. He's funny, and easy to listen to.",,
"He's funny and a good teacher you just have to pay attention and take notes, I rarely read the book and didn't always do too great on the quizzes but if you do well in lab you'll be fine it does take up quite a bit of time but its interesting",,
"Plan on this class taking a lot of your time, you'll be studying all the time. I really enjoyed the class and feel that I learned so much. Go to the open labs, do all the homework, and study!!",,
He's boring and his tests are tricky and dumb.,,
Shively is a really good teacher in that he knows his material. The class demands A LOT of time but its not hard to get a a good grade. just make sure to STUDY THE QUESTIONS IN THE BOOK! most times the test questions are exactly like them.,,
Anatomy has always been my favorite subject till I took this class. I took it as an elective. Shively's tests and quizzes do not coordinate with material covered in class or what is in the book. He seems to like to watch us all struggle and fail. This class was a complete waste of time-if it isn't absolutely required for your major- don't take it.,,
"The assigned textbook was completely useless, study off the one he wrote and you'll be setting the curve. I love this teacher, he knows so much! I'm taking another one of this classes next.",,
this class demands so much of your time! I did learn a ton about anatomy but the tests don't really have anything to do with that! I got above the class average every time but was still in the 40-60% range on all of them. If you attend class and study you will learn a ton but the tests and quizes are very overly difficult.,,
"Doesn't prepare you for tests. Hard test writer, often crude and offensive.",,
"This class becomes your LIFE!! Plan on studying 24/7. I don't agree with his tests at all. I think he should test you more on what you study, not how well you can get into his mind. He is very tricky with his tests. Something is wrong when you fail a test and your happy cause you know its at least average. Something is wrong with that!",,
"If the same passion of the Prof was shared with his students, there would be better grades thus better ratings. A little overkill for an intro. I'm just bitter because I dont have 15-20hrs a week to study because of famil/work/school. I learned more practical stuff about Anatomy and Physiology in my Emt Basic and Intermediate classes.",,
"Dr. Shivley is awesome. He is difficult but it will prepare you for any health related course you plan on taking. STUDY, READ, GO TO OPEN LAB and You'll do fine. Take anatomy from him. All the people who give poor ratings just didn't put in the time.",,
He thrives off of failing students and the on the midterm the high was a 62%! All the quizzes and tests contain material not gone over in class or in the text. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS FROM HIM!,,
"This class is very frustrating. His tests are so hard that getting an &quot;F&quot; on a test is good. That's a problem in my mind. If you can't or aren't willing to put ALL your time into this class, then don't take it from him! I have no problem in working hard and studying hard to succeed, but his class is beyond rediculous. Don't take it from him.",,
"Difficult, yes, but he tells you where test questions will come from--the questions in his book. Know the answers to those questions and you will be fine. Best professor I've had (I went to UVU and graduated at UofU). I am more proud of doing well in this class than any other--it was the hardest class I had.",,
I have done a huge disservice to myself by not giving this class the time it requires to do well. I have children and only arranged daycare for the time I was in lab and lecture. I should have put them in all day and treated this summer class like a full time job. Had I done this I would be a lot less stressed out. Don't make my mistake!,,
"I wanted an A and got one by having a study group, going to as many open labs as I could, reading the books, by not getting discouraged and staying motivated. Shively is always walking around school just waiting for students to bump into him and ask him a question. Hard class but worth it because you get a thorough tour of the human body!",,
"Plus- Shively is extremely knowledgable. He understands what he is talking about.He offers to help you outside of class. He can be quite hilarious at times.Minus- the test are indredibly hard and on top of that, Shively is always making mistakes so they have to be rekeyed.Students would learn more if tests were not so hard. Bonus- grades on a curve",,
"This class is difficult, but I learned soooooo much. Shively's quizzes are really hard, but as long as you do as poorly as everyone else, you'll pass. I loved his lectures, even though I was scared to death the first week or so. Don't put things off in this class or you will be sorry. Shively is extremely smart and willing to help you out.",,
"This class takes up your life!! Be prepared to wear around your under eye circles.. his quizzes are as obscure as his mind...he's very intelligent, but you have to think like he does during test time. he's hilarious and I made really good friends for the lab on this class. I suggest to NEVER PROCRASTINATE in this class.",,
"Hmm, will I have an &quot;A&quot; or a &quot;D&quot;&#63; A very common question among his students. This class is extremely time consuming, and most times very frustrating. Don't let your score of 25% fool you, it might actually be the class high on a test. Very hard teacher, but rather entertaining. Take his classes with other EASY classes! or else!!",,
Don't let his relaxed in class attitude fool you! Yes his lectures are fun and he is entertaining- but his tests will rock your world if you haven't read EVERYTHING in the test! Curve is the only way people pass so stay on top of it!,,
"If I were you, I would take a critical thinking class before taking this class. Half of the time I wasn't sure what he was asking for. When the class average is 40%(ish) or lower, then it is the there is something the teacher is not doing right. This class is insane. Plan on studying for at least 20 hours a week for this class alone. Good luck!",,
I cannot believe how much people complain and moan about this class!!. Yes it is very hard and challenging but you are given everything you need to succeed. Absolutely fantastic teacher!!!!,,
No one should ever complain about his anatomy class. Sure its hard but he gives you the tools to succeed its just a matter if you use them. If you plan on being in the medical field this class is a great eye opener to see what it is like. I highly reccommend his class. He is an amazing teacher and you will learn a ton.,,
"It's funny reading all the ratings. He's very hard, there's no way around that. But it all depends on your work ethic and attitude. If you are committed to working hard and have a good attitude about him and anatomy, you'll do fine. It's graded on a curve which helps a lot.",,
"Amazing teacher! He is very smart and his tests are challenging. There is a curve at the end, but you still need to work hard. It can be an imtimidating class when you first start because its a lot of information to cover in a lower division class, but if your going into the medical field or grad school its worth it. Good Luck!",,
"It makes me laugh to see everybody complaining about Dr. Shively. He is one of the best instructors I have ever had, and is very fair. He even curved my whole class up 25 points at the end of the semester. If you can't get a good grade with a 25% boost, you shouldn't be a science major.",,
I would have done better if Lab and Lecture for this class worked together and taught the same thing at the same time.,,
"If you are looking to go into anything w/ the medical field you need to take Shivley's class! It is hard, but if you study hard you will do fine. He's a great teacher and very funny.",,
"He is a very good teacher, his quizzes are extreamly hard though. This is not a class that you can just slide by in. You have to put in tons of time and effort. He is very helpful, and cares about his students so much! He wants us to do well, and understands that his class is very hard. He wants us to really know our stuff. Great but hard teacher",,
This course is super hard for an intro class. The majority of the class was failing all quizzes and tests. He would teach us the simple things and then test us on the more complex things that weren't ever explained in class. Good luck!,,
"Dr. Shively is the author of 3 of the books you have to purchase. so you go to class he gets paid to teach you then he chooses which text you have to buy, and of course he wants to put more money in his pocket!!!",,
Do not take this class unless you plan to become a doctor! He pushes you way harder than it is worth for a lower level class. In fact I think the professors think it is an upper level class. You can take anatomy online from another college and trust me it is much easier! Also you have to put in way to much time for a 4 credit class!!!,,
One of the top two professors of my college experience. Dr. Shively cares about helping students learn. He is one of the few teachers at UVU that pushes his students because he wants them to realize their potential. He is extremely fair with his grading and anyone who says otherwise didn't put the time or effort into the class.,,
For all of those who say this class is unfair and too hard...you probably didn't put in the necessary amount time. Doc Shively is an extremely good teacher and he is very clear about you need to know for his tests. I recommend taking this class with a &quot;lighter load&quot; or during the summer because you do need to put in the time to be successful!!,,
"it is a good class, but just be prepared to work at it like crazy!!!! I really think Shively is a good teacher, but he is a hard one, so don't go into it expecting a mildly challenging class! study his book CAREFULLY. his tests are hard, but after a while you can start to see how he writes them and study for them accordingly and ASK QUESTIONS",,
"I have never written a bad review about a professor before, but Shively is honestly one of the worst professors I have ever had. He is extremely arrogant, extremely disorganized, doesn't follow his own schedule, it takes forever for you to get your tests back, in all honesty, avoid him if you can, you don't even learn anything with him.",,
"Easy class. Take good notes, study throughout the semester to avoid the big push at the end. I studied maybe 1 hour a week, and 5 hours the week before the final and got an A even before the 20 point curve.",,
"Dr. Shively makes this class simple. He is very specific about what will and won't be on the tests, and explains things very well.",,
"Shively is AWESOME! Absolutely loved the class! I am not an extremely smart person, but put forth the effort, and got an A in the class. I don't get how people say he is unfair. Its those people who are trying to get out of studying and get an easy A. Study, devote your life to it and you'll do fine. I HIGHLY recommend Shively! He was the BEST!!!:)",,
He is just way too smart for his own good.I stuied my butt off and I still did terrible. You learn a lot but still do crappy on the tests. This class was way too hard for being an intro class.,,
"Shively was one of the worst teachers I've ever had. He's extremely arrogant, and believes he is god's gift to anatomy. He is not there to teach, he's there to prove to you how smart he is. Luckily, I ended up with an A because I stayed ahead of the curves, but that was no thanks to him.",,
"Shively is a great instructor and really knows his stuff. His quizzes are pretty difficult but not impossible to get a good score on. Use good, I'm mean very good test taking skills but studying hard is the key and don't get discouraged. Also, take advantage of every opportunity that he gives for extra credit. It will pay off",,
"He's super hard, but knows everything! really awesome guy!",,
"Class was very interesting and Shively keeps you entertained. The class requires a LOT of effort though, but if you work hard it will pay off, there is a big curve at the end so the goal is to just stay above the average (which tends to be around 40-60%). Would not recommend taking this class with other classes that would require a lot of time...",,
"Love this professor- lectures are humorous, informative and interesting with anecdotes designed to clarify and stick. Tests are the devil, the wording is tricky, requires more knowledge than was given or contained in the book. But, big curve at the end (I averaged high 50's, low 60's, & got an A.) Still, love Shively- great guy.",,
"Make sure to take all easy classes if you are going to take this class. This was the hardest introduction class I have taken. Lectures are awesome, he knows his anatomy and he is always keeping the mood light in the classroom. Tests and quiz's are impossible to do good on. Take the class and study hard. Major curve at the end.",,
"Though his knowledge and expertise are unquestionable, Shively is a worthless teacher. Common sense is not his strong point and i would never recommend his class to anyone.",,
hardest class I have ever taken! You will hate this class! Don't take it!,,
"This class is very interesting and you learn a lot, but the tests are packed with material so you have to study tons and theyre still impossibly hard.",,
Way good teacher. His book looks cheap but is the most useful study guide I have ever used. Its a tough class but I learned tons from Doc Shively.,,
Words tests so they are next to impossible to understand. And students do not receive results of tests a quizzes till sometimes a month after it was taken. Very hard to study for the next test/quiz when you don't know how you did on the first one.,,
Great teacher.,,
Great Teacher,,
"Very hard class, no matter how much effort you put in you still get a bad grade.",,
"Class was hard. He knows his stuff. Made things clear to understand, but there are a LOT of &quot;things&quot; to learn. Study hard - you'll be OK.",,
"This class is ridiculous. Shively is a trickster, just cause you know the everything about the question, doesn't mean you'll get it right. If you want to memorize a 500 page text book then take this class. Also, plan on going to open lab EVERY night from 10pm-12. But yes, huge curve at the end.",,
"Don't be fooled by the songs and jokes, this dude doesn't mess around when it comes time to take a test. I studied my arse off and never got better than a 70% on a test. Took it again from Dr. Bayer and did MUCH better.",,
"He is a Nice guy, but who cares&#63; he wants to fail you, I spent every night at lab, and it was not good enough, he wants to trick you, IMPOSSIBLE tests! he knows his stuff, but does not want you to learn it or would not make it so hard!. Take it at BYU, take it somewhere else. He is obssessed with the subject,even wrote songs about it!way too hard!",,
"HARD! tons of time spent studying for this class. he makes it entertaining and makes the material comprehensiable, but his test are CRAZY! just stick it out until the end NO MATTER what. at the end you will see a HUGE curve and as long as you put the time into it, your grade might not reflect it at the moment but at the end...its victory",,
"Let's be honest. His tests are rediculously hard. You would think after giving a 30 point curve on the 2nd test he would get a clue, but he didn't. he makes it unbelievebly difficult and demanding on your time. He is a great teacher and makes lecture really fun. If your going to take him be prepared to eat, sleep, breathe anatomy.",,
"do what he says, study alot, live at the lab and you will do well -",,
Very good teacher. Knows everything about anatomy! Test suck BUT keep going there is a BIG CURVE! If you do anything and everything he asks you'll pass the class.,,
"No matter who you take it from, anatomy is not an easy class. Shively is very entertaining and makes lectures fun to go to. He is very interested in his students and tries to know everyone by name. If you do you part and study your butt off you'll love this class!",,
"THis guy is an effective teacher, however, his course is quite demanding on time and effort to pass with a semi-decent grade. I work full time and do not have 30 hours of study time to put in to this freakin class.",,
"I heard this was the hardest class ever. I got an A, but there was a lot of memorizing, but what the hell do you expect when you learn anatomy. Doc Shively was great! WAY FREAKIN SMART, and knows his stuff!! When you figure out how he tests the tests are easy if you study a little! Great teacher though this class was great!",,
"his class is hard but if you have to take anatomy, take if from the best. he writes the test for the other anatomy teachers so you might as well get the info from the source. be prepared to hate yourself and do NOT take other hard classes with this schedule. theres only so much time to eat, sleep and study uvsc anatomy.",,
"He is the most amazing teacher you can ask for. He has a ton of students every semester, but he tries to help you individually with any questions. You have to spend a lot of time studying, but its an amazing subject and totally worth it. Anyone who says different is a total whiner.",,
"Dr Shively is a good teacher, and I did learn a lot. My one complaint is that he seems to really enjoy trying to trick you on his tests. As mentioned in other ratings, be prepared to work your tail off.",,
"Shively is a hard teacher, I won't lie. And his tests are WAY hard too, but overall he is a way nice guy. I recommend him, but just remember that the class is hard regardless of the teacher :)",,
"Anybody who talks bad about this class are the ones who keep UVSC's stereotype of &quot;glorified high school&quot; alive. This is a REAL college class. So quit spending dad's dollar and put your face in a book. You get what you earn. Dr. Shively is the best teacher I've had yet. Very helpful with any question, any time!",,
"I consider myself to be a great student, but this class was too much. I had to put in 35-40 hours a week of study and class time for a 4 credit hour class. I had to use his book that he wrote that was not edited and had no color. One day in class he said &quot;I can not beleive how stupid this class is&quot;. Horrible teacher that is only there for himself.",,
"Dr. Shively is awesome. He makes class so interesting. This class is really hard, but I learned so much. It's not impossible to get a good grade as long as you put lots of time into studying. I'm not a straight-A student, and I came out of this class with an A. Just make sure you're ready to work your butt off.",,
This has honestly been my favorite class. Dr. Shively is a great professor! Just be prepared to study and work hard.,,
I liked this class but was not easy. Shively is by far the best teacher on the subject.,,
REALLY FREAKIN HARD,,
The only reason Dr. Shively's students don't get high scores is because the tests and quizzes only include 25 and 50 questions each. He is very interested in helping his students and a lot of extra points have been added to tests lately.,,
"its a crazy workload (tons of busy work) with limited lab hours, some of which are a 10pm to midnight window. Many of the questions, especially on lab tests, arent clear cut in refference to the desired answer and more often than not pleading your case is futile. No one cares where you took the class so unless you are a glutant for punishment take",,
smiles when someone fails his class.,,
"Amazing teacher, But you have to know how to study, those that say he's a bad teacher just aren't mature enough to know what is expected with a real teacher.",,

Excellent teacher!,,
"This is the best class at UVSC. Don't listen to anyone that tells you it's hard -- as long as you can memorize, you'll be fine. There's a ton of material, but nothing is difficult to understand. Shively & Homan are AWESOME. You DO have to live at school to get an A though, so be ready for 12hr study-sessions!",,
"Wow, really really hard class- but all the anatomy teachers are the same, they have to be so take it from the man, Shively! He knows his stuff. Be prepared for no social life- I was at school from 9am-midnight almost everyday but it paid off cause i got an A, it's not impossible! Good luck!",,
This was the hardest class I have ever taken. I pride myself on being intelligent and have always gotten really good grades. On that note.....I did HORRIBLY in Dr. Shivley's class. He is a nice person but the class is rediculous for an intro class.,,
"Doc is probably the best teacher at UVSC. He isn't easy and bad study habits die a hard and painful death with him. I retook the class after an E that woke me up from apathy, got an A. But I put it all on the line. The book, blue study guide and engage him all the time worked for me and my group. Can not recommend him enough.",,
Dr. Shively is the best teacher I have ever come across. The class actually tests your capabilities. If you want a professor that is passionate and wants you to succeed than I would definitely take it from him. If you put in a good attitude expecting it to take alot of work than you will come out satisfied.,,

"Shively is a wonderful teacher! No the class is not easy.. This class will make you think, by the time the semester is over you will really know your stuff. He is willing to answer your questions even on his time. If you do the reading, ask questions & study hard. You will do great! If you don't do these things the class will kick your rear!!",,
"An awesome teacher! Very helpful, tells you exactly what you need to know & how to study it. the class is way detailed though, so take it seriously and plan on studying your butt off if you want to pass.",,
"very hard, and intends to keep it that way. I had a 4.0, and I couldn't pass his class. It's just ridiculous",,
"I hated this teacher, he was freaking horrible! He didn't even teach what you needed to know, and never clarified anything. Absolutely terrible, never take him!!!",,
"Dr. Shively is one of the best professors at UVSC. He is very interested in his students and tries his best for you to understand the material. The tests are a b****, but if you study and I mean STUDY you'll do well.",,
he tests far beyound his teaching.,,
No Comments,,
"Dr. Shively wants his students to learn and is very kind and respectful to your questions. On the other hand the you have to make anatomy your life for a semester if you want to pass. His tests trick you and I don't think that is fair. Overall, he is a VERY smart and nice guy.",,
"Dr. Shively is a great teacher. He makes things interesting and has a great sense of humor. The only problem are his tests, which are very frustrating because he tries to trick you. I guess that is good for weeding out the bad pre-med students, but too drastic for intro to anatomy",,
He is very nice and willing to take time to help any of students. Super smart.,,
"Want a hard but fun anatomy class&#63; Take it from the MAN. Shively is one of the few respected teachers at UVSC! Take that Dr. Parker! Shively spends alot of time with the students and has built a very nice anatomy course! Hard, but worth it if u go into grad school!",,
This is the best teacher ever!!! This is a very hard class because everyone wants their doctor/nurse who's working on them to know their stuff. Shively is a walking dictionary. Who better to learn from than the man who knows it all! He really makes it fun!,,
No Comments,,
"I loved this class,he taught so well and made it fun. It is one of the hardest classes at UVSC. But if you put in time you will learn A LOT and get the grade you want.",,
He is a very good teacher. his tests are very tricky and people often fail his class. but don't be scared. you'll do fine if you study.,,
"Dr. Shively is the only anatomist on on this side of the country. He wrote the book so the tests are really hard. If you're going into medicne, take anatomy from him. He helped me decide on a career in the medicne field.",,
No Comments,,
Horrible teacher. Smart guy. Very confusing when he lectures. He jumps around and is very scatter brained. I went in for help on multiple occasions and he told me to not worry about it 'it won't be on the test'. But then those concepts were on the test and I did poorly. I ended this class with a C- which is the lowest grade I've ever received.,,
"My advice to any student looking to take Biology would be, find any other teacher in the school to take this class from. Whaley is a very smart man. However, he is not a good teacher. You will have to read & teach yourself. His tests are difficult and have strange wording. He is also very disrespectful when he tries to answer a students question.",,
"Go to class, take the pre-lecture quizzes, and do the extra credit he offers! He even posts exam practices that are pretty much the same as his exams, so there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to be prepared for them. This class is graded heavily on exams, so if you study and make sure you understand the concepts then you'll be fine.",,
If you're confused during a lecture don't ask him just google it or something. Because he'll just confuse you even more. There's quite a heavy work and little room for messing up (just like most classes). Exams are borderline brutal and he offers very little extra credit to fix that. You're supposed to read all 24 assigned chapters. 30 Pages each.,,
"My major is biology because I love it! But after the first day of class I realized what I was in for... lots of late nights of stuDYING and tear covered papers. I've failed almost every test and I've studied like crazy. He likes to play the 'guess what I'm thinking' game, but he thinks really oddly. He requires so much outside of class.",,
Hardly learned anything from the teacher. The most you will learn is from the kid sitting next to you and the internet. When asked questions he either gets frustrated or repeats himself exactly how he worded it the first time. Tests are really hard and there is a lot of homework. I'm a good student and I felt I was drowning.,,
I'd rather be replace my visine with onion juice than sit through another lecture with Mr. Whaley. If being pubicly insulted is your thing Simply ask a question during class! You will be quizzed everyday. You will read everyday. You will be required to do work with his TA outside of class which is the only time you'll learn something.,,
"I am not very good at Biology, but this teacher made it that much more difficult for me to understand. He knows all about biology but he can't teach it worth a darn. He is constantly yelling at students for asking questions. He requires you to meet with his T.A's every week and they hate him too. They were my only saving grace to pass this class.",,
"Not a good teacher. The course is fine if you're driven to learn on your own, but he probably won't be much help.",,
"Oh man, where do I begin? Great charisma and absolutely loves what he teaches. Should teach more feild classes! Real fun and easy going, will work with you if you need it too. Would take future classes if I could.",,
"Dont take classes from Whaley! He is incredibly rude to students and doesn't understand their questions. He can't talk clearly, and doesn't even understand his own power points. Worst teacher I've ever had.",,
Does not like to help students and is rude when questions are asked in class. He never understood where students were coming from and confused the class every time he tried to clarify something. He really just wanted to teach Ornithology to the class when we were in 1610.,,
"Expects you to teach yourself the material. Gets irritated when you don't understand. He is a horrible teacher, doesn't understand questions. Gets things mixed up while teaching. Very confusing. He's a nice guy but a bad teacher.",,
"Wayne is a nice guy, but a horrible teacher. When you ask questions in class he hardly ever understands and will go off and answer a totally different question that has nothing to do with what you asked. He requires you to buy the expensive clicker, text book, and online access. His tests and quizzes are also worded strangely and extremely hard.",,
"I feel like his lectures are worthless. Don't be fooled, this isn't an easy A. You never really know what's going to be on the test unless you have a good TA to help with the recitation session. You really don't know what you need to study but it's based on total points so do all the homework and get 100% on that.",,
"Its possible to get an A, you will for sure learn the material, but most of that will be accredited to the homework you do. If you ask a question in class, he won't understand it, he'll go on a big rant about something unrelated to the question, and a person who sits by you will end up answering your question.",,
Couldn't stand the class. He constantly lectures about pointless issues that have nothing to do with the class and treats not being as intelligent as him as a crime. You must buy the overpriced book and expensive clicker if you want to pass. Turned biology into my most dreaded class even though I love bio. Doesn't answer questions either,,
"Whaley is a nice and funny guy but he isn't a very good teacher and his lectures are pointless .. you have to go though because clicker questions are worth a lot on your grade. The only way to pass is to study hard for the tests and read each chapter thoroughly because the tests are hard, but they are all curved (including the final) which helped.",,
"Great guy, but poor teaching skills. I would not recommend taking a class from him unless you already have a good understanding of biology and enjoy teaching yourself the material. He gives tons of pre-lecture quizzes and the tests were rough. I didn't learn much from his class.",,
"Wayne Whaley is an extremely nice person, but doesn't really know how to teach that well. HIs lectures aren't very clear, but he try's his best to help you. I don't really recommend this class if you aren't serious about learning. Clicker questions are a big part of his class.",,
Terrible. Doesn't provide any help outside of class. Requires you to already know the information and do the homework before he teaches it to you. Completely useless as a professor.,,
"This class if fairly simple. If you have any background in chemistry or previous biology classes it will be a breeze. Tests come directly from lecture slideshows and the practice exams he offers on Canvas. Exams are very straight forward. Mandatory recitations are worthless, but lectures are bearable.",,
"I'm reviewing Bio, though I also took ornithology from him, since I think it's more applicable. He will expect you to put in effort and respect his field. The class will not be easy, but totally possible and you will learn more than you ever have from a class! He loves birds and butterflies so take upper division from him if you get a chance!",,
"This class can be challenging at times, but it's not because of the professor. Some chapters are just difficult. He provides you with more than enough resources to succeed. Practice exams helped a ton. He drops your lowest test score, and the final is really easy. There's also a few extra credit opportunities. If you do your part you'll do well.",,
"Expected us to only prepare one presentation and to come every week so we can critique the other presenters. Fairly easy. However, the bio department tried to make us write papers as well, but it was turned down. May be enforced in the future. He does interrupt the presenters fairly often to give his 2å¢ even though it's not his presentation.",,
"The only reason I got an A in this class is because I took intro bio and a principles of chem courses prior to enrolling. If you don't already have a strong foundation of both bio and chem you will struggle in this class. He talks at about 1000 wpm on a bad day, and doesn't listen very well. But he is committed to making sure you learn.",,
"Rough class Whaley doesn't know how to lecture you will have to learn almost 100% on your own. The MB helps a lot and recitation sessions help as well, but it's still hard. You have to go to the recitation sessions too it's not a choice so add another hour into your work time that you didn't plan for. We had a sub yesterday and I actually learned.",,
"Whaley's class is tough, but worth it. You have to read the chapters before you come to class and study a lot outside of class. He provides more than enough resources for you to stud from however, and as long as you follow directions, its an easy B. Dont do stuff last minute, attend class, study, attend recitation sessions and do MB = good grade.",,
"His tests are very difficult, and it's hard to know what to study for them. However, he is willing to help you if you go to his office. If all you need to do is pass a class, take him (you'll still need to do a decent amount of work). If you're looking to get a higher grade, you may want to take a different teacher.",,
unclear and disorganized his TA told me that 1/2 of the class will fail as if to brag about how hard he makes the class compared to other teachers.,,
"Despite what people say, Whaley is a good professor. People are mad that he doesn't spoon feed them what they need to know for his exams, well welcome to college. You have to read the book before class to understand the lecture. Clicker questions during class count as a test score. He wants students to understand and will help outside of class.",,
Prof. Whaley want's people to do good on tests and gives lots of time in class for questions. The key to his class is reading the text BEFORE class. All of the pre-quiz stuff comes out of the book and will really get you started on the topic. Do your vocab and make sure you know what his slides are referring to.,,
"This guy is literally the worst professor I have had. He babbles incoherently about the subjects at hand and his powerpoints aren't helpful. You have to read the chapters word for word or you won't pass, and on top of the normal required lab he has required labs of his own that are counted in your grade. He is unbearably bad at teaching.",,
"I have no interest in biology but professor Whaley is a super nice guy. He can be condescending at first, but if you get passed that he really cares about his students and their quality of learning. Not many professors dedicate as much time to their students as he does. It wasn't an easy class, you have to read the textbook but at least you learn.",,
"Whaley is a nice guy but he is not good at teaching BIOL 1610. His lectures are confusing and boring. Youtube videos will be your best bet to understand what he is talking about. His tests are multiple choice & aren't super hard. He is using the clicker so people show up to class because honestly, you could pass this class without ever showing up.",,
DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS!!! I had to drop this class becuase it was way too hard and Whaley doesn't teach well at all. He has powerpoints that have the information for the tests on them but then they end up not having the information needed. He expects you to not memorize the information but to learn it and apply it on the test. DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS!,,
"Do not take Biology 1610 from Whaley. He is so confusing and doesn't teach anything that is on his tests. Not only that, but he expects you to know things that aren't even in the book. He goes off on random tangents about birds all the time. He doesn't ever understand any ones questions so you don't get a clear understanding.",,
"This guy is a terrible professor. He is constantly contradicting what he says. When students have questions, he can't answer them clearly and just says the same exact thing he said that made them confused in the first place. Don't get me wrong, he's undoubtedly a great person, he is just terrible at teaching.",,
The only reason he is a teacher is because it's a job in biology. Puts his own bio interests in the lectures that have nothing to do with the test. Very long and difficult quizzes are due before class every period. Lectures are useless and confusing. He just fills in for the bio department. Expects you to learn all from your reading. Find another,,
"Worst Biology Teacher at the University. Such a hard class, filled with useless information. Others in lab with different teachers knew so much more than Whaley's students. His powepoints were so long and useless. Puts his own interests into the lesson rather than what we need to know for the test. He doesnt even like to bio. He just fills in",,
"Dr. Whaley is the worst. I am an A student and I had to drop the class. Daily powerpoints are 80+ slide long. Test and homeworks are so hard. He does not care to know who you are and hates anawsering questions. Find another teacher at all costs. He threw in so much useless information. He even told us he does not like this biology, but zoology",,
He's one of those teachers who thinks all you do is attend their class and study biology. Half of the tests he gives are open on saturday and if you take them on monday you pay a fee. If you dont understand the concepts prior to class you may leave confused as he mixes up words and concepts. He's a less than average professor.,,
"Very scatter brained, and hates awnsering questins i class. He loves laughing at himself teaching because he doesnt comprehend that his students dont understand what he teaches. DO the MASTERING BIOLOGY and you may pass.",,
"I went to class everyday, took notes, did my homework and reading. I went to every review session possible and I did horrible. I have never failed a class before and I have good grades. He was not helpful. He talks fast and expects you to learn a lot from your own reading. He doesn't give you time to process the info and some of it is irrelevant.",,
"Dr Whaley is a good guy that wants to help how he can. His lectures can seem unclear at times but are atleast somewhat helpful on average bc he gives similar or even exact questions on quizzes/tests. I can see why some ppl think he's condescending but his intentions are good. Just not as sensitive as some, he's an east-coaster. Easy A if you study",,
Showing up to class will prove uneventful given that it is entirely possible to get an A in the class from simply showing up on the first day and once again on the last day for the final exam. It is likely that many students will gain nothing from showing up to class on a daily basis.,,
"A lot of students don't like him because he is a &quot;hard&quot; teacher. It's the amount of material that he has to cover that is a the problem for most students, they just use him as a scapegoat. If the Student wants to succeed, Whaley helps the student do so, but it is ultimately up to the student to decide how well they want to perform in the class.",,
"he is a great guy but does not know how to teach these classes at a lower level. upper level classes are great. he does not like to answer questions, tests are way hard. take another teacher if possible, if not you will live in your book if you want to pass.",,
"Professor Whaley is a Zoologist whose passionate about birds, and butterflies. So the only way he's managed teaching his 1610 micro biology class, is because he's memorized his 5 year old PowerPoint lessons. He doesn't like taking questions. He doesn't have a study guide. He writes his tests like riddles. Must self teach from book to pass class.",,
Love this Man. He really enjoys teaching upper division courses. I took him for 1610 and worked my butt off for a B. I barley put in 1 hr a week in ZOO and am getting an A. Definitely take Animal Behavior from him. Fun class and laid back grading.,,
"You knew you were signing up for a class taught by an ornithologist, how interesting did you think it would be&#63; Extremely painful to sit through class as he reads verbatim off the slides. Teach yourself, be discipline in reading and mastering biology you'll be fine. If you thought this class was hard take Ochem, your defintion of hard will change.",,
Real smart man. But terrible at sharing what he knows. Very confusing. If you take his class plan on learning the stuff on your own because his lectures are not helpful at all. I had the hardest times staying awake in class :( A zoologist teaching biology didn't seem to mix well,,
"Definitely a bird man. Little scattered sometimes on his lectures. Read the book, attend class and go through his power points and you will do fine",,
"Professor was interesting. However, he was knowledgeable in the field (hence PhD, though it is in Zoology). The book was used a lot, but his tests are straight out. I would recommend attending class since he gives out a lot of tips for tests. overall: Great, just more fast-paced.",,
"Mr. Whaley is decent. His tests and quizzes are quite easy even without reading regularly as long as you show up to class. However, if you're actually trying to learn the subject it can be very difficult. He's is very poor with answering questions and he often goes on long tangents. Easy for science credit, poor for learning.",,
His lectures are ridiculously hard to understand and he never actually teaches the material covered on the 6 midterm tests that are given during the semester. You are forced to learn solely from the textbook. I would avoid his class like the plague but I hear the other BIOL 1610 teachers aren't any better...,,
"Professor Whaley is a sweet, sweet man. I regret to inform you that he isn't the best teacher. He speaks very quickly and doesn't answer questions very clearly. I wish he was my grandpa rather than my BIO 1010 teacher.",,
"The professors teaching capabilities were low and came off as extremely condescending; especially when questions were asked. He also tested way harder than the level that he taught and even quizzed at. One on one, his personality is great and you can tell he means well.",,
"Pretty good teacher. He can be a little confusing at times, but he gives you his power points, which if you know, you know the test. He requires you to have a very conceptual understanding of the material. You won't do well if you are not willing to read and STUDY his power points. He gets you ready for the DAT and MCAT if you are pre health bound!",,
"Whaley is a pretty good teacher. you really have to understand the concepts to do well, you can't just regurgitate information. the tests were fairly challenging, and you do have to actually study the book and the powerpoints. he offers extra credit, which is helpful. i would definitely take another class from him.",,
"This professor was awesome! I had him a few years ago and he was tough, but I learned so much. He taught Biology 1 and 2 when I was preparing for the MCAT and I scored a 14 in Biological sciences. AWESOME. He is passionate about biology and about butterflies, and that passion shows when he teaches. It can be contagious if you will let it!",,
He is the man! He is so funny and is really helpful. You have to read the book and go to class. At the first of the semester he is kind of strait and blunt with people but as the semester goes on and you keep coming to class he likes you and is even better.,,
"Wayne is a great professor. It has been a while since I have taken any science courses and was a little nervous for this class. If you go to class, take notes, read the chapter at least once and STUDY the STUDY GUIDES you should get an A. I would study about 1-2 hours a day. Good Luck!",,
"How to do well in his class: read the slides, study the practice tests, do the end of chapter quiz's. Honestly this was NOT that difficult of a class. Just don't depend on whaley, go to the study center or make friends in the class",,
If you like reading the book and getting no help from the professor then Whaley is the teacher for you. He has been rated for the past 7 years and still has horrible ratings.,,
This most worthless class ever. You can tell that Dr. Whaley hates teaching it. He stutters around questions and is generally unhelpful. His class is pretty easy as long as you read the book and go over his practice tests. He gives one in-class quiz at the beginning of the semester but after that don't even bother going to class.,,
"I really don't understand all the negative comments about Doctor Whaley. I find him amiable, humorous, and genuinely knows his material. Sometime he can go off on tangents and forget to answer a question, but overall, I think he is a great professor.",,
"Before I took a class from Professor Whaley, I loved Biology. This man's style of teaching, or the lack thereof, is completely ridiculous. His lame excuses and patronizing &quot;disscusions&quot; get old very fast. Don't take Bio from Whaley, whatever you do. He is understanding sometimes, but most times, he'll just tell you to &quot;change your major.&quot;",,
"Do not take this class from Whaley! He was no help in letting the class know what would be on the tests, I got better grades when I didn't show up for class on the tests then when I went all the time. The final was awful and he made no effort to tell us anything that would be on it or tell us what we should study.",,
"Whaley rocks! He knows his stuff, he's enthusiastic about the topic, and he's always available to help his students. Clearly if you're unwilling to put actual effort into learning you need to choose a different major.",,
"Great as a person outside of class, BUT A HORRIBLE TEACHER!! When asked a question, he wouldn't answer, or would expect you to know. Wasn't able to answer his own test questions, test questions were incorrect and from a different book. He is not the teacher for learning Bio.",,
"If you can't handle East Coast personalities don't take him. Otherwise, he's great, just study!",,
"Whaley is a cool guy, and makes his class as easy as possible. He tells you specifically what will be on his tests, so if you aren't getting an A, it is your own fault.",,
"Whaley is a character. The first three sections I went every day and studied his power points, I got a 67, 72, and a 71. I started going once a week, and studying the book only. I started getting 90's on his exams. He was rude to me whenever I went to his office to talk to him. Stay with the book, you'll be fine.",,
"Prof. Whaley is very scatterbrained sometimes. I hardly attended class and got a good grade. He tests straight from the book (and uses questions from his practice exams). Whenever I have tried to talk to him he blew me off, demanding to know why I was in his office, and that if I needed something to hurry because he has a &quot;lot to do.&quot;",,
Hard class you have to study like crazy!! Prof. wasn't too bad though.,,
"Dr. Whaley gets a bad rap. His class is hard, but this is college. 1610 is in the top three hardest biology classes on campus. Do homework and study! I studied over 30 hours for the final, but I got an A dangit!. If you want a free A change your major",,
"wasnt helpful, kind of rude and if you dont attend the class make sure you take every test and get a good grade.In class he doesnt talk about whats on the test.beware!",,
"You dont need to print off powerpoints.do pay attention to what he says, sometimes his test questions come from random things in class. there are in class extra credit quizes. help sessions-attend! i recieved a b+ by reading each chapter 3xs. pretty much memorize book. not a bad class tho. if you cant pass this class...change your major!",,
"HE IS A DEDICATED TEACHER. GOOD TO HELP IF YOU ASK FOR HELP, OFFERS HELP SESSIONS.",,
"Passionate about his job. Not a horrible teacher. not clear at times but helpful if you ask questions. tests are hard but he grades on a curve. he budges under pressure. you'll most likely get a better grade than expected, I did.",,
"he speaks another language! He is unorganized, and doesn't answer questions well.",,
I think he gets a bad rap. I liked him for the most part.,,
"most tests had uncovered material, that wasnt found in book or in lextures. I studied hours for tests and was boarderlinning a C-, the Final wasn't as tough as all the tests, overall this class was hard, i learned alot although my final grade reflected a C+",,
He might know the material he is teaching but he is terrible at getting that information to me the student. He tells you to remember things that aren't on the tests. If you enjoy teaching yourself biology and wasting time in his class and then teaching yourself through the book you'll LOVE this class. Worst class i have ever taken.,,
Not a terrible teacher. I thought he was ok. If you think his class was hard and you are a biology major than i would recomend changing majors cause his class was one of the easier classes I had. He is a little scatter brained but he explains what you need to know,,
"I really love biology, but Whaley ruined it for me. His tests are ridiculously stupid, he tries to be sneaky, but it just comes across as confusing. I HATED his teaching style, he goes through dozens of powerpoints in a class just reading off of them. It almost seems like he has no idea what he is talking about. I had a very negative experience",,
I learned a lot in his class. He gave fair warning of what would be on his test. If you study the given power points with the text book in hand you will learn the information. If you don't go to class or don't pay attention you will not do well. This is the nature of Biology.,,
"Great teacher. Tests were not the easiest, but he made sure to cover the material and also made it clear you need to read the chapters or you have no chance. He is one of the best teachers I have had I would take a class from him for sure",,
"He's not the best at explaining stuff so you'll end up reading the book half a dozen times. His tests are l ike passing a kidney stone. seriously. If you are good at learning on your own, i'd recommend him. You'll like the way he puts stuff &quot;best hearing you'll ever hear.&quot; &quot;much more lesser&quot;",,
"His class was hard, i paid good money for a hard class i didn't want an easy A. His lessons were very confusing, it forced me to read the book ahead of him, and in doing so i learned the material very well. From my experience with other biology teachers, he is just as confusing as the rest. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS TEACHER TO PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY CARE.",,
"Prof. Whaley is an insanely hard teacher. I even heard one of the hardest in the west, and it's very easy to believe. It's a hard course, no doubt, he expects you to study about 2 hrs per hour of class time, and you'll need every minute of it! He's hard but good. Most students who do well in his class go on to do well in the MCATs'.",,
"Had alot to expound upon, does get behind and then rushes through to get caught up test were tricky sometimes but was fair. Can't complain w/ an A-",,
I didn't really see anything terrible about him. I didn't think his class was that hard. His tests have some tricky questions but I have had way harder tests than his. He is always willing to help you with whatever you don't understand and is entertaining. His big fault is he is a bit unorganized.,,
His tests are so hard. I studied like crazy and I still failed this class. I didn't really go to class because I didn't understand anything that he was teaching because he goes through it so fast. He just says read it and then you'll understand it. I wouldn't recommend him.,,
"He has got to be one of the worst teachers ever. The first day in class he says that if you want to do well on his tests that you have to study the text and the CD that comes with it. I took that to mean, &quot;I'm a terrible teacher and won't teach you a thing so your on your own.&quot; I was right.",,
"Professor Whaley delights greatly in the dimise of his students. The test on genetics was so unbelievable difficult and excruciating i considered sending hate mail to Dr. Whaley. Its almost that he wants us to learn to fail, rather than learn biology to become med students. Very dissatisfied with his teaching ability.",,
"Dr. Whaley cares more about covering the material than helping his studets to understand and learn. He does not answer student questions in a clear way, instead just restating what he said the first time(which caused the confusion in the first place) It almost seems that he wants his students to fail rather than succeed. He is a horrible professor",,
"very bad teacher...arrogant, childish, selfish, unclear. he actually made people in my class feel bad/stupid for asking questions - they wouldn't ask questions again after that. i got an A, you can if the text becomes your best friends and you are willing to put up with a dork/jerk for a teacher and &quot;jump through his hoops.&quot;",,
"Worst teacher at UVSC. I have had some bad ones, but he truly does not care about helping his students. I saw too many poor kids get torn a new one for asking something in class. Steer clear of this one if you want to get what you pay for with your tuition.",,
"Personally I like Whaley and his teaching methods. He does make you work HARD for your grade though - I was taking 14 credits and studied about 50% of the time for his class. I got a B in his class and an A in all my other classes. Good news is, he really teaches you EVERYTHING in detail.",,

"This teacher sucks big time. He's probably the worst teacher i've ever had. Like everyone else said, it would be easier for you to read the book and do it on your own. He's very easy though.",,
"Many people have told me that they are sorry for me when I tell them I have Whaley for bio. I don't see why I think he is fair and is teaching at the level he should. He always asks if anyone has any questions. Somewhat frantic teaching methods, but entertaining. I would take him again.",,
Whaley is a good professor. I had a wonderful time in his class. He helped me understand bio. If you want to learn something take his class.,,
Goood teacher. Really knows his stuff. Really wants you to learn.,,
I really enjoyed Dr. Whaley's class. His way of teaching keeps you interested in the subject. He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to learn as much as possible. He does enjoy butterflies and if you can get him to talk about them it's worth you while. what a great guy.,,
"Very good teacher. Please disregard comments made by people who probably shouldn't be in any kind of biology course. His classes are tough, but they should be. I'm glad I was able to take him.",,
Dr. Whaley has only one thin on his mind...Swallowtail Butterfies. He's the world's foremost authority on the subject. But he has very little time or patience for first year Biology students. He has no interest in making sure you understand the material (very disorganized) and heaven help you if you ask a question in his class. Caveat emptor!!!,,
I studied for countless hours and I still came out with a horrible grade. I went to class everytime and used every study method I could think of. If your not a genius don't expect to get a good grade in this class.,,
"This is a hard class, it is right up there is math 1050. I read the book and came to class and studed, I did well. no matter who you take this class from it will be hard",,
ever seen the movie Waynes World&#63; skatter brained and half the time he doesnt know what he is talking about. the text book he uses sucks. take this class from another school. i wish bybee thaught this class. the lab is a joke! it reminds me of high school science projects.,,
Dr. Whaley is a great teacher. Very clear and helpful for Bio students yet he is tough on his tests.,,
"unorganized, apathetic, and basically didn't seem to enjoy or understand how to teach the class at all. The school should only employ him to do research because he is not qualified to teach",,
Not very good. I would not recommend taking him.,,
I thought he was a great teacher!,,
"Avoid this guy, he's a fool. All these people who say &quot;you just have to read the book and you'll be fine&quot; are right, but thats always the case in every class. Find a different teacher who can actually teach you something.",,
You must have missed class buddy. None of his lecture had anything to do with the test nor did we ever go over the tests. You are right about the tests being from the book but not as clearly as one would think. Take this class elsewhere before coming,,
"I thought Dr. Whaleys class was very informative. Those that complain probably never read their text, his exams are are a direct reflection of the text. Do your part and you'll be fine. Recommended.",,
No Comments,,
What a moron! I don't know where this guy acquired his degree but he can't teach. Beware Bio at the U or the Y prior to coming here. This teacher sucks!,,
"Skatter-bained! Take chem before his class, you will have to correct him many times. Don't recommend him! Can't teach, doesn't test on what he teaches, most class time is off topic. No point to attend class! I acquired all my knowledge from the book.",,
You're all a bunch of ****. He's a decent teacher at least you know what he is going to test you on before each test.,,
"Unfortunately he is the only teacher for 2110! He is a terrible teacher. Nice guy, but doesn't know how to teach. Be sure to have at least some chemistry background because when he gets into that his students have to correct him a lot of the time!",,
"If you don't mind tangents, go ahead. Just be aware that if you ask too many questions on side issues, you just lost the day's lecture.",,
"Good Teacher, a bit erratic with a one-track mind. Don't mind the spittle.",,
"easy, but you have to read your book!",,
I would never take this class-especially online. I have never seen someone who would never communicate with his students. I tried to contact him few times and I gave up. I don't mind about lots of homework or whatever but he is one of the worst professors I have ever met in my entire life.,,
"I would not recommend taking this course online. The teacher has a very structured and organized course. As well as a bunch of lectures that took him some time to make, so props to him. However, the tests are very hard to understand. If you take this class... study study study. Go over every thing. Especially the Chem section...",,
"Took online. I hate his trick question quizzes and tests. I've gotten mostly 100% but I have to sit there for hours and analyze. He uses fancy vocab in his lectures with out defining his jargon words. He doesn't communicate at all with you through emails and such, not even if you use canvas. his links to learn more about concepts never work- EVER.",,
I would not recommend taking this class online. It was very difficult for me to understand the lectures. He requires his students to take the final exam at the UVU testing center so you really need to know what is going on in the class if you want to get a good grade on the exam. For now on I will be taking my science classes in person.,,
Be prepared to spend half a semester stroking the ego of Charles Darwin only to have no questions about him on the final. This class was horribly structured and after studying all online materials I could find for a bio 1010 final I walked out of the test blindsided by the 3000 level questions. Not to mention he never responds to emails.,,
"If you're unlucky enough to get this course, GET THE OPTIONAL TEXTBOOK. The teaching model is poor, with ridiculously long reading assignments, and 3 question quizzes over the material (quizzes are 25% of final grade). The textbook helps to condense & explain the material. Some quiz material is not covered in the online videos. The textbook helps.",,
"His tests are really difficult. I would study hard for them, visit him to ask additional questions, and would still get C's on his tests. This was the same story from my other classmates. He is a decent guy and you will learn A LOT. But you may struggle keeping your head above water during the semester Consider taking Professor Bayer- Choose life!",,
"There is no book, just random websites he assigns you to read from. Instead of basing the tests on the information from the websites, the tests are based off of Biology textbooks that we don't use. Because of that, the tests are VERY hard to study for. Also, the final was really hard (no study guide). The class average was 51/110.",,
"Dr Parker is fairly nice and wants to help. He will answer questions that you ask in and after class. Grade comes from tests, but the lowest exam is dropped and replaced with top 10 quiz scores which is helpful. His tests are difficult. They are meant to trick you. Super ambiguous questions that leave you guessing even when you know the material.",,
"I have nothing good to say about Professor Parker. As others have said, he didn't have anything to do with the course. To expound on that, none of his exams matched the course material he used (but did not create), and the final exam was mostly chemistry questions, which matched neither his stolen course material or his mid-terms exams.",,
"Absolutely ridiculous class. Uses material and lectures from a different professor, tests are arbitrary and impossible to study for, the final was super heavy on one section of material, and, again, impossible to study for. Yes, I passed. Yes, I got a decent grade. But this class was way too much of a headache. Do not take from this professor!",,
The material is copy pasted from a three year old course that he didn't even create and then tests us on material NOT from the online lectures (think BIOL 3000+ material). Written assignments are graded by a TA so he doesn't even do his own grading for ANY of the work. Why should I bother to put in effort into class when my teacher doesn't?,,
He isn't even teaching a class he put together. Its a 3 year old course from another Prof. He doesn't seem to understand the online system. Incredible amounts of reading assigned in a very short period of time. Tests cover the most minute details. This is not biology 1010. This is a 3000 level class. Do not take unless you literally have no choice.,,
"I don't know where he gets the materials for everything, but quizzes, tests, and exams all seemed to have different information. I would get 100% on the quizzes and tests, and then get into the exam and walk out with a 50% feeling like it was all new information. He basically just reads off the slide shows he has prepared. It was a confusing class.",,
"Seems like he wants you to learn bio, but does not want you to do well in the class. Lessons are general but tests are specific and cover things not discussed in class, they are loaded with trick questions. If you are a bio major looking for a challenge then he is great, but if you are just looking to get your 3cr GE bio credit then there is easier",,
"The workload in this class is ridiculous. You could easily spend 2 to 4 hours per day just trying to keep up with this class. The quizzes are very difficult, the exams are even worse. If you retake the quizzes the second set of questions is always harder than the first. I would not recommend anyone taking this class from him. I should have looked.",,
The quizzes and tests are NOT based on lectures or reading... The only helpful information I found for this class was Quizlet... study for the exams using Quizlet and you will score will... if you actually do the work expect to be befuddled on the exams...,,
"I took this course online after earning a C+ years ago on the main campus. I ended up with a letter grade lower the second time around. The course online is doable if you will set aside time to study. It's easy to do the assignments but the tests are more difficult. If you aren't a good test taker this class isn't for you,the final exam is tough!",,
This was my chance to retake biology (I passed several years ago with a C) I thought this would be an easy shot since I am in my third year and know my stuff. Not so!! The material was way harder than necessary and I didn't learn a thing. Doesn't let you go back to check answers on quiz and everything is on websites and 2 hr long videos on Darwin.,,
Not book based teaching. All things expected to learn are from websites.,,
"Really great teacher. I don't understand all the negative ratings. Every time I had a question he would stay after with me to help me understand it. If you go, take your notes, etc you should get an A, he tries to have everyone get an A. Lectures are long but he makes them fun. Really just don't be lazy. Great guy, great teacher, great class.",,
His tests are awful! He writes his own tests but he shouldn't. so bad! trick questions galore!,,
The class is in a lecture hall so it's not super exciting. He did a good job being engaging though. It was a good review if you already know something about biology.,,
DO NOT TAKE. Parker is a hard teacher. He doesn't work well with the students. Tests are tough.,,
"The test questions tend to be trick questions; he's just trying to get people to be better test-takers and read each question through thoroughly. I personally thought the in-class clicker quizzes were the hardest. But it's nice, because he dropped the 5 lowest assignments, quizzes, and the lowest test. He's good at explaining things.",,
AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!!!! He treats you like you are a lesser being and expects you to pass a timed 30 minute quiz that he is weeks away from covering the material and the quiz content is hardly on his slides and the chapter readings are about 100 pages each with fine print. So good luck trying to find the answers on your own.,,
"Professor Parker makes a lot of comparisons with everyday things, which can get a little confusing. I basically teach myself Biology and we have quizzes all the time about material we haven't even covered yet. It's not a hard class, but it can be quite stressful and inconvenient.",,
"He's a good teacher and explains things well. He tries to be funny (usually isn't), but at least tries to make the class relatively interesting. However, I wouldn't recommend taking the class because he tests you on material he hasn't taught yet. His lessons are about 2 weeks behind the tests and quizzes so you're required to teach yourself.",,
"I'm not going to lie, this is a hard class. You have to know A LOT! But Professor Parker is a good teacher. He's really funny and is extremely nice and helpful when you have a question. You won't need a textbook other than for the LearnSmart assignments he makes you do. All of his tests are based off of his PowerPoints and old exams, so take notes!",,
Professor Parker is terrible. I was seriously confused the whole semester and when you ask questions he makes you feel really stupid. I would not recommend Professor Parker to ANYONE. Tests are really hard and when you ask what chapters in the text book that are being covered he says all of them.,,
"Dr. Parker is great teacher. He's a little odd but gives interesting and relevant metaphors to help you with concepts. Lecture based--I did not even buy a textbook. Grades are 100% quizzes and tests, which I actually liked. Take notes and you'll do well. The many negative ratings surprised me; I would definitely recommend him.",,
"This class was not at all as bad as everyone said it was. Dr. Parker is actually a really good instructor; I learned really well from him. Tests are hard, but he gives you plenty of material to help you succeed, including lecture recordings and Power Point slides. Don't fear all the negative comments on here, I really liked Dr. Parker!",,
I didn't realize until now that I ended up getting a B+ in the class & I have NO idea how that happened because I only passed one test the entire semester. He walks and sweats and rambles the entire class. He reminds me of Kevin from the office: boring. He just lectures and only has exams so you need to study EVERYTHING in class. Do not reccommend.,,
"This class was not easy. If you follow the course objectives and use the old practice exams (extensively), you'll pull off a good grade. It was a lot to take in, especially for someone who isn't majoring in science whatsoever.",,
"I thoroughly enjoyed this class. Dr. Parker is tough, but that's what helped me learn the material. He goes over everything really well and he spends plenty of time answering questions. He now records his lectures, provides you with all of his slides, and gives you some great materials for studying for his exams. He's loads better than people say",,
"Worst teacher ever! I have now taken this class twice and have passed both times, but not with a very good grade. Your grade is weighted by exams and quizzes, which are nearly impossible to understand. A friend of mine taking biology at BYU looked at one of my quizzes and said that it was harder than the test she had recently taken that day.",,
"By far the worst teacher I have ever came across. Went to him several times and ask for help because I was struggling and he simply told me to 'Do better.' Test you on things you haven't covered yet, ramble on about nothing, no homework to help your grade, and no matter how hard you study the material, it's always different on the test. Horrible.",,
"Doesn't respond to e-mails, rambles about nothing useful during class, doesn't follow chapter outline of textbook, grade is based solely on exams and a few quizzes - no homework to cushion grade or help with understanding of concepts. Nothing but a cause of stress. This class is the reason I no longer have a scholarship. I even had a tutor.",,
"All you have to do is go to class and listen and you'll pass. I got a B, if I studied or did the quizzes I would've been in the A range. Tests are there to make you think and understand the concept not make sure you can memorize. Use the practice tests and you'll score well on the test.",,
"Dont expect to pass his class. He is not a good teacher. He is on chptr 10 but, all the hmw to be done is online and they r on chptr 13.he wont mov dates. His test don't make sense. says his test r only on stuff covered in class &they're not. There is nothin on your grade but the exams. no homework no attendance just the tests.",,
"HOrrible teacher to communicate with. Sent emails, canvas messages and no response ever!! How is a student suppose to communicate with the professor when he is ill. His lectures are hard and and test format is confusing. Only thing good about his class is that he records his lectures.",,
"Professor Parker is SUPER HARD but he teaches everything you need in class. He expects you to know EVERYTHING from his class. Sometimes it is confusing but go to him and he will clear it up. FOR AN A:go to class, re-listen to his lecture till you know exactly what he say and how he says it. Test are from 80%current lect 10%past lect 10% 1610 book",,
horrible class. no class interaction just lectures the entire time. he goes on tangents all of the time but still expects you to know everything. his study guides aren't at all like his tests and he has a lot of work for you to do. He treats you all like you know everything already. it's nearly impossible to pass his class.,,
"DON'T TAKE IT. Tests are tricky. There's no hw to cushion your grade. He takes your top 10 best quiz grades to replace a test grade, but even that doesn't help. I had another Biology professor tutor me and she said the material he taught should be in advanced bio classes and he didn't make sense of his questions. Avoid him.",,
"Dr. Parker seems as though he wants you to learn but his test questions can be difficult. Don't miss class and when you study for the tests, stress the details covered in class and on the powerpoints. Your grade will seem to be low because of your test scores but if you do well on the quizzes, your grade will be better than expected. Good luck.",,
"He says everything that we're tested on is in his powerpoints. A lot of the time, things are not in the powerpoints or they're in powerpoints that we haven't even covered yet. So things that haven't been introduced in class (or the powerpoints he's gone over) are on the tests. He gets annoyed if you ask questions in email, or doesn't answer email",,
"The worst biology teacher I have ever had. He's rude to students questions in class. Tests are extremely hard, and questions are very poorly written. Quizes are hard but if you work in groups you'll be okay. Is a horrible teacher. This class could be really cool, but because you spend the entire semester trying to figure out what he wants its not.",,
The worse professor at UVU. He should not teach. He doesn't care about students nor your learning. He is lazy and will not answer your questions. Studying will not help and listening to lectures won't do much either. He has tenure but needs to replaced fast. There needs to be another option for cell bio at UVU. Unfortunately will not learn much.,,
"He is very vague, and then his tests are super hard. I have taken biology twice, including a college prep biology class in high school and still have no idea what is going on during the tests. Questions are worded weird and when he is asked questions about stuff in class he tells stupid stories instead of answering it coherently. AVOID THIS CLASS!",,
"He is an average lecturer. He is pretty clear most of the time. Although most of what he tests on is taught in class he seems to stress things differently than the book. Some things he stresses are not even in the book. This class was difficult for me for this reason. Also, fill in the blank quizzes are vague and it is difficult to guess his answer",,
"Horrible teacher, do not take him if at all possible. Choose another professor other than Parker. He makes his class and quizes easy and then when you think that you are catching on and you know your stuff, his tests come along and wipe you out and ruin any chance of a good grade. Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!!!!",,
"This class was an extremely easy one, literally all the material on the tests is covered in class, and explained in enough detail in class that if one pays attention you don't even need the book, I never had to study because it was just that easy. t",,
Course lacks structure. Doesn't use the book very much and the lectures are aimless. I have a 3.8 gpa all science/math courses (no generals) so I feel I know my stuff..don't take this class from parker. Hardest (and not the good kind of hard where you actually learn) B+ I've ever gotten.,,
"If at all possible wait until there's a better teacher you can take Cell Bio from. Doesn't test you on huge sections that he covers then asks for overly specific things on stuff he talked almost nothing about in class. Don't take from him, have have been warned.",,
"Parker is one of the most intelligent professors I have ever been instructed by. He shares an extensive amount of knowledge with his students. Sure, the tests are a bit difficult but college isn't supposed to be easy. Parker always advertises his ability to help one-on-one. This class is hard, but if you actually try you can get a lot from Parker!",,
Wait so what you talked about for 20 minutes wont be on the test but the 5 second mention of an additional protein will be a third of the test questions&#63;,,
This professor is awful. DO NOT TAKE HIM! Unclear on everthing. tests you on material never discussed in the class. REAL BAD TEACHER,,
He is a pretty cool teacher. He says that everything on the test or quizzes will be talked about in class which is untrue. He has a quiz every weekend that covers materials which are worded strngly and covers materials he has not talked about. He is a cool funny guy but his test is a little hard.,,
"His test is based on what he talks about in class. He posts old tests, and his power points he goes over in class all on blackboard. He explains it in a way that can be understood. he drops the lowest quiz grade, and test. I liked the way he taught, probably best teacher i have had.",,
"I would recommend not getting the book, his tests are on the things he talks about in class. He dumbs down his lectures so you feel like you have a grip on the material but he doesn't dumb down the tests. He goes into way more detail than necessary. With teachers like him it's no surprise that Biol 1010 is the most failed course at UVU.",,
"A teacher so bad he was hung in effigee by students. Test material is not found in book or covered in class. It's easy to feel like you know what's going on in lectures but when it comes time for a test, quiz or anything else you are going to be graded on it's another story. Asking questions is futile. He dodges them. Take Bio from Bybee or Harris.",,
At any cost do not take this teacher. you will learn nothing but yet somehow its really hard to get a good grade.,,
"Horrible teacher. He was unclear about what the tests were on and the tests were awful. Extremely hard class, DO NOT TAKE IT!! I usually get A's and i got a D. Do not take this class.",,
It is just a hard class in general. He only tests on what he lectures on though. No surprises. He even posts tests from the previous semester that help a bunch with studying. He offers to sit down with each student individually to help you out if you need it.,,
His general biology course is fairly difficult. Makes you memorize specific things that are useless. 25 minute 'recap' of what we learned last time. Only really learning 25 minutes of new content each class,,
"I really liked this teacher. He was very clear, and though there is a book, you don't need it. The only things on the test are from lecture. Take notes. He always reviews what last lecture was about, so it's nice if you miss. Open note/book quizzes on BB. Just go to class, take notes, and study the exam objectives. You'll at least get a B.",,
worst teacher ever. i went to almost every class and copied the power point notes word for word. i read the chapters and made note cards for every test. i would study for hours and failed most of them. none of the material learned in class is on the tests. it was horrible. i normally get all a's but got a c in this class.,,
I had this professor last semester and he was awesome. For those that complain that it was hard I can only say get over it. Biology is hard and if you thought 1010 was hard wait until you get to upper biology you will kill yourself. The test were hard but he does a good job preparing you and he does teach what is going to be on test!,,
he's a really nice guy and when you go to class it seems like it won't be super hard if you pay attention and take notes. but when you take tests and quizzes you realize that almost nothing that was discussed in class is on the tests. EVERYTHING is from the book. the only way to get a good grade is to memorize the text book.,,
"Biology is a really hard class in general I think he's a pretty funny guy, he helped me when I needed it. The tests are difficult and the quizzes he gives every week were also difficult, you really have to know the information he teaches and if you don't know ASK and read ahead in the book. I liked him as a teacher but biology is just a hard class.",,
"My advice: STUDY!!!! his tests are extremely hard. He quizzes you on things he hasn't taught yet so you're gonna have to read the textbook. You're only graded on quizzes, 3 exams, and the final. The good thing about this class is there's no homework. Just study hard. I'm lucky if I even pass this class.",,
"Frustration is the theme of this class. Lectures are barely useful. The test questions were in fact written by Hitler. Condescending looks and answers to your questions are typical. I managed an A, no thanks to him, I just neglected friends and family for 3 months to study. Boycott this &quot;teacher&quot; he contributes to Americas poor education. HORRIBLE.",,
"Horrible teacher. Lectures were often irrelevant to tests and quizzes. Your text is your only hope for a good grade. Tests are very specific lectures are very, very vague. I went to talk to him on two occasions over a concept I was struggling with and was met with rudeness and disrespect.",,
"Unpleasant expereince! Very poor teaching style. Teaches casually, but tests VERY specifically. Don't take this class from this teacher. He has so little trust in students and plans teaching and material around that. Please be aware if you are an &quot;A&quot; type student.",,
"Biology is a difficult subject--but he did a great job explaining it. He was always there after class if you had questions. He also warned you what he tested on. Those who thought this class was beyond difficult must not have realized what to expect for any biology class. I learned a ton, but it wasn't easy. It did help he did several quizzes.",,
"I really Liked Dr. Parker, he is a tough professor, but it does pay off especially if you want to learn something! If your in school just to get grades don't take him. If your here to learn, and grow, and to really become informed on the subject of biology, well then Dr. Parker is great!!",,
"This was the worst teacher ever! I went to class everyday, wrote notes word for word then re-wrote my notes, read the chapters, then studied the study objectives and still only got a C+. He sucks. Words can't even describe how terrible he is. Do not take this class.",,
just get out of the class while you still can. i'm a straight a student and i barely passed the class. i studied at least eight hours a week and still did terrible in the class. just dont waste your time or money for this class. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS GUY!!!!!!!,,
"He is a good teacher, and the lectures are easy to understand. He teaches what we need to know but doesn't help how to study. The lectures and study guides are unorganized. His students are responsible for making them in order & organizing to get good scores for the tests.",,
"Definitely not an intro to biology class. Tests are WAY hard and that is the basis of your whole grade. There is one research paper, which he grades harshly. He never returns emails. Could quite possibly the worst professor at UVU. He definitely ruined any interest I had in any science field.",,
Parker is the most worthless teacher I have ever had. I have emailed him several times and never get anything back. He had surgery this semester and we had a sub for over a month who was WAY better then him. He takes forever to explain one concept and has analogies he uses that make him sound like a retard and they make it was harder to understand.,,
"AVOID AT ALL MEASURES. Seriously, I saw his reviews and still thought that i could handle his class, but i couldnt. He is so unclear about everything he teaches, and when you do understand a subject, it isnt on the test. The tests are so hard, and i think my class averaged a 62% on one test. If you are looking for a good grade, then abort the missi",,
"He as a person is a nice guy, but teaching is not his high point... which is interesting because he should be a good teacher since that's his profession....",,
"Hard teacher, not recommend if you are taking this class for general ed. credit.",,
"I had his class. I enjoyed and learned much. We were supposed to study 2 hours for every hour in class. But when I actually did do that, it didn't help whatsoever. The paper wasn't too bad. I honestly don't know how the hell I got a C+ in his class. I still don't know what I got on the research paper or the final to this day. Oh well, the classisov",,
"worst teacher, just stay away from him",,
"He is a nice guy, but that's about the only good thing I have to say about him. All you have to study with for the tests are his lectures, which have nothing to do with the tests. His tests are impossibly hard. To top it off all that your grade is made of is three tests and the final. You are MUCH MUCH MUCH better off with any other teacher.",,
"Dr. Parker is very nice,very intelligent. However, he teaches as if he was at an Ivy League University and as if we were all biology majors at an Ivy League University. What is discussed in class has almost no relevance to what is on the tests. Unless you are a science nerd avoid his class. He needs to work on his teaching skills.",,
I am a straight A student and I pulled a D in his class. I tried to study for the life of me for his tests but did not help at all. His tests are very hard and his lectures in class do not pertain to any importance to the information on the tests. almost no homework a very confusing man. verty nice and very intelligent but doesnt know how to teach,,
"Parker is a nice guy all around. However, his teaching skills are terrible! He just stands up there and lectures to you like you already know what the heck he is talking about. Looking back on the semester I should have missed all his classes, read the book, and I would have received the same grade. He puts useful powerpoints on his blackboard.",,
This professor is extremely useless to the idea of teaching your students what a joke. please find someone else dont get this joke you will regret every moment. wheres the fired button.,,
"Parker was RIDICULOUS. He lectured with out powerpoint the first 3/4 of the course. His analogies are so ridiculous that everyone ended up more confused! In addition, His tests were ridiculously hard and confusing. If you have to take BIO 1010, let him be your LAST RESORT for a professor!",,
"No required text, all lecture based, classes are usually 100+ students so questions aren't very effective. Not much homework at all, however grade depends on 3 or so quizzes, 4 tests and a research paper. Tests are HARD!",,
I do like his personality and way of teaching. His tests are half info from class and half knowing how the entire WOLRD works! I did learn some from his class because I had to work my butt off to even get a 65% on the tests. He does normalize which is how I pulled a C. But I am a straight A student! He is hard to get ahold of out of class.,,
"Parker is a good guy just a crappy teacher, impossible to get a hold of. If you try to talk to him in person he just says email him, when you email him he never replies back. His tests are extremely difficult! Only nice thing is you have no homework. You do have to write a 3-5 page essay one time in the semester. He's definitely a terrible teacher!",,
DONT TAKE THIS CLASS PERIOD! WORST TEACHER AT UVU!!!,,
This class was way rough. I never missed class and still had no idea what he was talking about. He is very hard to get in contact with and when you do contact him is isn't very nice or helpful at all. I wouldn't take this class if you don't know anything about bio because he jumps right into things and moves very fast. The tests are very hard!,,
Professor Parker is really hard! All his material comes out of his lectures so missing class is not an option. I had to miss several classes due to my daughter's health problems and Professor Parker would never return my emails. I had a really difficult time with this class.,,
"This is one hard class and Parker is not the easier professor to take it from. His tests come out of his lectures so I thought taking notes would be enough, but his tests are REALLY hard. I'm a straight-A student and will be hoping to pull a C out of this class.",,
"Bruce is a nice guy, very knowledgeable about his subject, and good at explaining it. He assigns a very light load of homework, and only does a few quizzes throughout the semester. I do need to say though, that his tests are HARD. He's a great teacher if you want to learn the subject, but you need to study long and hard if you want to do well.",,
"Extraordinarily, fantastically, impossibly, massively, excruciatingly painfully, nerve-wrackingly hard. He made all my other professors combined look like softies, and I was only in a 1010 class!",,
"Man, Dr. Parker is HARD!!! I am a 4.0 student, and I found his tests extremely difficult. You can study for hours and get a C, if you are lucky. He is funny, easy to get help from, and good at explaining concepts, but the tests are impossible. I liked Parker, but would only recommend his class to science majors.",,
"Man, I got rocked. He is a great professor and is willing to help you out but his t est are still way tough and they really challenge you. Throughout his lectures you can sit there and listen and engage in what he's saying but then you come out not knowing what he was talking about. He makes it a lot more complicated than it should be.",,
"Alright, I may have already taken 2 years of biology prior to this class and STILL don't understand it, but his tests are HARD! I got a 61% percent on his test and still got higher than most of the other students in the class. And I studied my BUTT off. But other than that, there aren't assignments and if you understand biology inside out, take it.",,
"He is a very hard teacher!!! He really knows his stuff and you can tell when he lectures, but it's hard to learn from his lectures. I would listen and take notes and his tests still killed me. The tests are very hard and if you don't know your stuff inside and out you won't do very well. He doesn't give a text book and doesn't have homework.",,
"Good teacher! Hard class if you're not a math person. Tests are tough, do the homework!",,
"Weber was my favorite teacher this semester! I think he had a rough go of it transitioning into the Business classes but I think for his first semester he did a good job. He's a nice guy. Can be intimidating, but I recommend just getting to know him! My discussion TA (Julia) is what made this class rough, not Weber.",,
"I liked Weber. He's nice, funny, and teaches things in a very organized way. Would definitely recommend!",,
Professor Weber hasn't been my teacher for several years but I still go to him whenever I need help on math problems. I like the way Weber teaches. He makes you work for it but he's there for you the whole way. I'll keep getting help from Weber as long as I can. He makes math much more enjoyable for me!,,
Weber is wonderful! Good teaching style. Approachable. Get to know him and he'll be your best friend.,,
Tests are hard! Doing homework and going in for office hours helps a lot though.,,
"Professor Weber is a good guy and a fine teacher. I don't particularly love the subject but Weber made this class easier for me. I recommend you buy his note packet, it's helpful! I also recommend you visit during office hours if you need help.",,
This was his first time teaching this class so the transition was a little rocky. Still I think he did a fine job and I enjoyed this class a lot. I would recommend Weber to anyone.,,
Loved Professor Weber! Always available during office hours. Good teaching style. Difficult tests. A little intimidating at first but once you get to know him Weber is the best!,,
"Hard class but so much easier if you try hard and are respectful. Get to know him, he's a nice guy.",,
This class was not easy for me but Weber was awesome. Go in during office hours if you need extra help!,,
Weber is quirky and fun. His class is laid out well. Lots of homework. Tests are hard.,,
"Weber is a nice guy. If you come in with a good attitude, ready to work, this class will be great.",,
"Professor Weber can be hard to approach, but once you get to know him he's a good guy. Students are hard on him but it's usually on them for not taking time to go visit him during office hours. He's an effective teacher and a nice guy. If you think otherwise than you're probably part of the problem.",,
I enjoyed Weber as a teacher. He rekindled my love of math.,,
"Mr. Weber is not a bad teacher. He doesn't grade fair, if you have to make up a test he grades it himself and is a lot tougher than the grad students that do it. In lecture he will answer questions but makes the person feel stupid. Lectures are slow because no one will answer. My adviser told me she had heard from a bunch of students he is not good",,
"If you walk into class with a bad attitude, it's going to be hard for you. He is one of the best math teachers I've had. If you ask questions during class he goes through step by step. His tests are tough but if you put effort into the homework, you will be okay.",,
"If you begin with a negative attitude in the class, either pertaining to the professor or the material, he will pick up on it. If you are negative, the class becomes ten times harder. If you work to be friendly and participate, Mr. Weber will become your best friend. I passed this class with flying colors and found it quite easy.",,
"A very hard class if you don't put the effort in. If you do try, it's not too bad. Weber offers a book with all the notes and in order to succeed I suggest you buy it! He goes through that thing the whole year and if you have it you will do a lot better. Overall average teacher, but you have to work hard to do well.",,
"His teaching style isn't all that great. If math is not your strongest subject, you probably will struggle.",,
Didn't teach. Makes fun of you when you come in for help.,,
"Weber is a good guy, it sucks that he's a terrible teacher. This was his first time teaching this class (History of Math) to the best of my knowledge, so maybe I just had a bad experience off that. He's a tough grader, it's really hard to tell what he wants sometimes.",,
"Bill is not a nice person to meet with in office hours. I realized after 5 visits that I was wasting my time. Get a tutor, get through the class and don't look back. He's also the department head for college algebra, so I'd advise taking any retake at LCCC Albany because I retook Webers class once after failing and failed the second time.",,
Best math teacher I've ever had.,,
"Mr. Weber is a fine teacher. He has high expectations and getting to know him can be challenging in such a big class. If you are struggling and want to succeed I recommend visiting him in office hours. One on one he is kind, supportive, and one of the best math teachers I've ever had.",,
Many of these comments are unfair. Professor Weber is incredibly knowledgable and supportive. It is important for students to make an effort. Weber respects students who work hard and put time into his class. I recommend going to office hours and paying attention in class. Classes are large so it's important to make yourself known... in a good way!,,
"Mr. Weber is incredibly helpful. Students need to put forth the effort, visit him in office hours, pay attention in class. If you are respectful and work hard than this class will be great.",,
"I don't think the other reviews are fair at all. He isn't rude only to those who disrespect him in class like talk or have their phone out in plain site. I do recommend going to every class. You'll be good if you're there, follow along and take notes in class. He is VERY helpful if you go see him during office hours!",,
"He is a very interesting grader. If you like to get perfect grades on your assignments it probably wont happen in this class. You pretty much copy down whatever he writes on the board but don't do any examples. Online homework is very easy, but test are hard as you didn't do examples at the caliber of the questions on the test. Poor class.",,
"Weber is a good professor if you can live up to his type of teaching style. He's extremely rude though if you are to ask a 'stupid' question. I took this class twice, and still didn't pass with a C. I had peers that were in for their 3rd and 4th attempts. Take this class online through LCCC or EWCC.",,
Difficult but here are my suggestions: Attend ALL lectures&fill out his course packet. Be polite to him. Ask for help after class and in office hours. Write down all your work for online HW even if you aren't doing the notebook. Do the ENTIRE study guide and practice test to study for exams. If can do those comfortably you're set.,,
"Dr. Weber really does try to help his students, but is very rude if the student asks a question that is 'stupid' in his opinion. He teaches formulas and rarely does more than one example of a concept. I have learned more from Kahn Academy than from him. I would not suggest him to anyone. He grades very difficult.",,
Most comments put forth about this teacher are pretty accurate. The prereq for this class was as easy A for me. I then get brutally savaged by the first test. My primary complaint is his inability to teach what you need to know for the test. I took my W and will be retaking it with a foreign student as a teacher. Yes Weber is that bad.,,
Is a really nice guy you just have to understand him! Good humor. Course is incredibly difficult for a 1000 based course! If you need help seek office hours. If you attend class and put in work you will pass with a C. Don't expect much higher! Lectures are very boring. Exams tough (40 % of grade)! Homework easy (half is online).,,
terrible teacher. monotone...boring...just writes as you copy... no practice in class... test way harder than any problem on homework or in class. stay clear!,,
Once you understand the Professor's sarcasm it becomes a lot easier to talk to him and receive help.,,
"The material Weber puts on his test are entirely far off from what is covered in class and on assignments. He frequently made mistakes when demonstrating problems on the chalk board that, on a test, would lose a student all credit points.",,
He gives fairly good lectures up until the sections become complicated. Can be very rude to students after poor exam grades and can be downright arrogant when talking with students 1 on 1. Does NOT prepare you for exams and does not give you a good idea of what material will be on the exam. Loves to 'massage' equations a little bit too much...,,
"He's a terrible teacher, the homework system is awful. He doesn't make anything clear, and the tests are hard compared to the homework (which isn't lenient to mistakes). DON'T take this teacher.",,
I felt that the homework was simple yet the tests were hard compared to what we were taught in class. I felt he didnt care about the sucess of his students. I did not enjoy this class because of him.,,
Not helpful at all... Tests are very difficult while class lecture examples are very simple in nature.,,
"It would seem that Bill's idea of teaching is to dumb the lectures down as much as possible so that the students think they're understanding the material, but then to give them horrendously hard tests in order to create artificial bell curves. Very state-school. Hopefully deans et al. can see through such tactics which constitute poor teaching.",,
"Sorry, but for someone of his stature in the UW math department methinks Mr. Skeletor here takes himself way too seriously.",,
this oddball really took his liberties with the exposition of the material in class-- none of which lined up with what he expected from us on the tests and homework. the 'textbook' was equally worthless to this end so I among many other students were just lost most of the time and were powerless to do anything about it...*sigh*.,,
"Condescending and disrespectful towards students. Not recommended, obviously.",,
My guy Kenneth is a god man. The guy really gives out open book pop quizzes that show you what's on the final/midterm and are free extra credit points for the final/midterm. If you do well on the first paper don't worry about the second one. A lot of people give up after the third week. Just show up to class and try on the final/midterm. Ull BeFine,,
"This is a difficult class, but do the work and you will pass. This class is based on a curve so if you beat the curve then you will be fine. He is a great professor and is willing to help if you ask for it. Many people stop coming to class or don't pay attention at all. Take the class do the work and pass!",,
"Class lectures do not have anything to do with textbook reading. He talks about sports cars and tells funny stories but he's off topic. Homework is 800 point quizzes (sometimes 1200 points) and difficult because you must teach yourself the material. Class is curved. 2 exams, several quizzes, 2 book reports. Proceed with caution.",,
"This online course is horrible. He communicates through Twitter (what? Like you are Donald Trump?), never reply emails or discussion board. The homework and quiz are nightmares, a lot of mistakes and he never correct them. Google his name and you'll understand that he doesn't have time to teach! He is busy doing other business call sex tourism...",,
He Aight,,
"My friend and I (straight-A students) got 14% on the final. Luckily, with Ng's generous (though questionable) curve, we received A's. Advice? 'Select All' on homework, and rekindle your relationship with God, because you're going to be praying to him a lot during the semester.",,
"Whatever you do, don't take this class! I did not listen to the comments and regret it. Choose a different professor.",,
"Very knowledgeable about the subject. Goes off topic, but covers everything. Gives good life examples. Class is not very fun, but if you write the papers (a well written paper) and try on the homework, you can pass. He curves to the class average, so if you try you can pass. Not the best professor, but if you try you can pass with at least a C.",,
Just google his name. It's mind blowing that this guy is even allowed to teach given his unethical outside of work activities. He wants to see his students struggle and makes the exams overly confusing for what appears to be his own enjoyment of watching people struggle. Avoid and take an Econ class where the teacher actually wants to teach. AVOID!,,
"While he may know the subject matter well & is knowledgeable, he often interjects his own opinions and views about things. While I don't agree with his opinions and views on certain things, I ignore those statements and comments from him. Homework generally has multiple right answers, so read carefully.",,
Very tough class for 100-level econ but if you're interested in economics it's well worth it. Several people including myself still receive A's because a majority of the class doesn't try. The curve is the only way to get an A. That being said I like his personality. He has a realistic view of the world which is a cliche for econ professors.,,
"Insane amount of homework, no help when you're online, for the love of God never take this class. it will save you months of stress and anguish. Please stop supporting this fool",,
"His lectures are soooo long, and he gets off topic fast. He really like cars and motorcycles, so most of the examples will involve either. He gives out two papers that are worth most of your grade, then you have a mid- term and final. I didn't do the first paper, but did good on the mid-term and final and I still got a B, so he's not that hard.",,
"his class was ok. his lectures were very long but everything he said would b on the quizzes and tests he gave. so u had to pay attention. he would try to be funny, it would work sometime but most of it were just eh. his voice is so monotone . im surprised i passed his class. his midterm and finals r based on books. ok if u dont finish. i didnt",,
Somehow I got a B. Pro tip if you are taking his class online. Every time there is a question that allows you to give multiple answers choose every single one. It won't dock you for getting one part of the question wrong and you'll receive full credit on the problem.,,
Took OL. Prof Ng was nice and available during office hours. Has a gazillion resources for his online classes. Grading criteria and grades were very clear. You get what you earn. Video lectures is recorded class lecture. Very fair IMO. There were 3 pop quizzes. OL exactly like in class. Cheap books. Moodle fully set up from the start.,,
This guy's lectures are almost about anything but not Econ!!! Very boring lectures!!! The grading is very hard to understand.,,
"if you think you could pass this class through hard work, then good luck. the only way to pass this class is through the curve and only the curve. i got an A tho",,
"He has way too many text books, his syllabus is and lecture notes are online is disorganized. It looks too overwhelming, I got lost. He has an online textbook with a different title than what he has on the syllabus. It's nice he enjoys teaching, but it's more like talking about things that aren't related to economics at first part of semester. :(",,
"So I literally learned nothing in this course, but somehow passed with a B. I honestly just did all the online homework, and when it come to the midterm and final, I just filled in all the blanks(I learned nothing in this class so I wrote what sounded logical). Beat the curve and you'll pass the class.",,
WORST THING TO EVER HAPPEN! Also used to run a blog to assist people in picking up prostitutes in in Asia (underage ones too) Grades on a curve but this person shouldn't be allowed near a campus!,,
"The one good thing I have to say about him is he doesn't hide anything. He has everything on the page for his online class. But his lectures barely helped on the homework and barely did anything for the test. I basically had to teach myself. Would not take him again, given the option, choose another teacher, PLEASE!!",,
"Professor Ng is an Expert in the subject, he is extremely passionated towards his profession, He tries his best to make the class laugh, and to understand it using various life examples. Now Honestly, I did extremely well in his class, because I Had an incredible Supplementary Instructor (Hadeer). If you do not have an SI do not take him. Honestly.",,
DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS,,
Just don't do it. Promise?,,
"Tip before taking this class: Order your coffin first day of class because at the end of the semester, you'll be in it.",,
He is confusing and tries to be funny. Received a D in the class. Some of my friends had better experiences. He does post everything online. He records his lectures so attendance isn't mandatory but your grade reflects your effort.,,
This is a warning for new students who want to take this class. His class is like freeway that every one entre and exit but your grade will be D or F. 70 students out of 110 failed and others got C and D. This professor final exam is bring 6 page papers and you have to analysis the paper then answer questions. Don't take if you don't want to be bad,,
I drove to this class without my seatbelt on every Monday and Wednesday,,
Very boring. goes off topic often and is a horrible professor,,
"He is very bad professor at CSU because he does not explain anything , and then he is demanding. His online HW I unrelated to his notes and text book. He has a online textbook that you have to pay for it at first of the semester, and this is a business for him. Also, his online textbook is very hard and nobody read it .",,
"His lectures are about anything except Econ. Also, his absurd PowerPoint presentation is based on business, women sex, luxury car and then gives ridicule pop quiz at class that nobody knows about it. A funny things is that pop quiz point is 10 and whole class get 1 or 2. Don't take him.",,
"Went out of my way to tell you to not take this professor. Goes of topic, explains vaguely, expects you to know the material yourself. 2 term papers, 1 midterm and a final along with homework that's difficult. Wouldn't recommend.",,
"This professor is by far the worst I have ever had! And I have had pretty horrible professors. His lectures are awful, he goes off topic often, and it seems as if his lectures having nothing to do with the exams. Avoid this professor if possible!",,
"he is useless. if you MUST take it, just know you are NOT going to learn a THING, but you can DEFINITELY pass if you enroll in the lab so the TA can help you and review the tests and quizzes. He curves from the beginning so you know where you stand. i was freaking out from the start but i got a B.",,
Do. not. take.,,
"This class is just work, work, work. I am usually good with keeping up with assignments but the way this professor sets everything up is just confusing! I go to every lecture take notes and pay close attention but to me it seems like the exams are just so far off from the lectures! I am so confused in this class and I don't understand anything.",,
"This is a very hard course and this teacher makes it even harder to pass. His lectures are long and he always goes off on a tangent and talks about irrelevant things. He grades the essay and tests by just putting your score on top of the paper; he does not tell you why you received that score, it makes you wonder how or if he even really grades it.",,
"If you do not go to class, you have a 99.99% chance that you will not pass! His lectures are long and boring. He often times goes off topic. He gives irrelevant essay assignments that have nothing to do what he is trying to teach us. The way he structures his test are confusing. Try and stay away from this professor.",,
"Waste of my tuition!! Worst teacher ever in my 15 yrs in school, pointless term paperS Doesn't explain anything, he thinks people already know Econ so he doesnt lecture on it Talks about irrelevant things Hate him , don't waste your time with this useless person",,
The only reason I recomend this class is because of the curve. When doing online and there are questions where it asks for multiple answers in one questions MARK EVERY SINGLE BOX! you will get full credit for that question! You will learn absolutely nothing in this class. Just beat the curve and you will do fine. I got an A and didn't read anything,,
"This is an extremely hard course. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Probably 60% of the class ended with a non-passing grade. You have to do many online quizes online, and MOST OF THE TIME IT IS NOT RELATED TO THE LECTURES.... Quizzes would take up to 6 hours for 55 questions with at least 2 people and yet you will score if you're lucky a B grade on them.",,
Took him online. DO NOT TAKE. He expects too much reading. Didn't learn from online and he never replies to emails.,,
"This teacher is terrible. The lectures are unclear, the work has no direction. The homework is all objective but yet there is still right and wrong answers... There is no help from him. The worst is when there are wrong questions on the tests and homework, that is pointed out by the students EVERY time. Do not take this class!!!",,
Do not take this class! He is a horrible professor! His lectures do not relate to his homework and he always goes off topic. Steer away from this professor if possible.,,
"EASIEST CLASS EVER! This class is not hard, just atten the lecture. Homeworks are easy. you do not really need to read. I did not read throughout his course any book he assigned, just skimmed them when term papers were due and I received the third highest A. My advice, GO TO CLASS and you will pass!",,
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF!!! Look elsewhere. Took the online class, got SO confused. Monotone, doesn't explain whats on the tests, just references old tests that he posts on moodle but even still the old tests doesn't give you answers, you have to do the work and hopefully you get it right. Does not respond to questions, just refers you to his FAQ.",,
"Terrible professor. His lectures seem to not be related to the course. If he handed out a sheet of notes on the topic with examples, you would have a better chance of understanding. Class is curved, but doesn't change the fact that he is unclear and makes many mistakes in typing, grading, etc.",,
"This is the worst professor I have ever taken. Do whatever it takes to not take him. I went to every lecture, studied, got help and tried my hardest and that wasn't enough. He has a pathetic curve that doesn't really help you out. His lectures, homework, and quizzes don't go with one another. You are forced to figure it out yourself. DONT TAKE HIM!",,
"I believe you need to go to the lectures to have the slightest idea about Econ. The lectures do not help completely when it comes to the test; you have to also read and do some side research. The term papers are annoying, however, you do learn a lot from doing them. I would not take this professor if you are easily stressed. Try your best!",,
"Not an easy class but study hard for it, and sit next to someone smart!! There is a logical way to think about Econ and an Economic way that goes into ECON Deeper. Do the hw, read the books for the term papers (helps alot), and try your best for the group quizzes for extra credit with a group of other people. You will do fine if you putin 110%!",,
"Two term papers, multiple pop quizes. Lecture are unclear and feel as if they dont pertain to the course/book chapters",,
"Compared to other econ classes, it's not that bad because he curves and there many assignments to boost your grade. You will pass if you put in some effort because of his curve. However, he is not helpful at all. You will study yourself entirely. Go to tutoring and do well on his papers. Even though you won't really learn anything, you'll pass.",,
Worst instructor I've ever experienced. Does not provide clear instructions for his assignments. Quizzes have incorrect solutions and is reluctant to change them. He does not help you with assignments. Doesn't teach you economics; he shoves free market capitalism down your throat. He is monotone and boring. He is very condescending.,,
the class is hard... i dont recommend taking it online cuz theres so much to keep track of. he does curve but if you dont do the homework and the 2 term papers your grade will drop easily... i wish he gave feedback on midterms because its confusing to know what you got wrong/right.,,
"I thought that this class was great. He gives a good economic perspective and is very clear with his class lectures. Be warned, there is a lot of reading. If you don't like to read or are looking for an easy, no effort class, take someone else. But with a little effort, an A is very achievable.",,
"He was a good professor. Kind of monotone, but interestong nonetheless. He has a very VERY generous grading curve, it helps A LOT! He is pretty easy going and give chances to recieve extra credits on future tests through pop quizes.",,
One of the worst professors I've ever had in my academic life! He rambles about himself and stuff that have nothing to do with MicroEconomics and sometimes he even comes in with powerpoints made about non-related stuff the course! For example motorcycles! and what bikes he used to ride when he was a kid.. don't even bother taking the class with him,,
DONT DO IT IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY. His main goal is to ramble about himself then trick you. He turns the simplest concepts into mind games and the answer is always 'it depends'. I learned more about the mans childhood than Econ. Don't do it.,,
Confusing as can be. Not Helpful at all. Tests are impossible,,
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF, The worst professor I have taken ever. He goes off on tangents and requires a term paper, His tests are difficult and tries to trick you. He seriously should be fired. I never write reviews but I really do not like this professor, IDK what any other student may say dont take him.",,
"He is the only professor I dislike.He likes rambling on about other things and then makes a poor attempts to relate it back the subject. He believes CSUN students are incapable of surviving in a more 'prestigious' university, that is why he curves. Test are mainly from powerpoints and book. I got a B but it was not because of his great teaching.",,
"If you just want to pass Econ 160, I recommend his online class. As long as you attempt the online homework and do the term papers with effort, you should be able to get at least a B with his curve because so many people in online classes don't do/forget assignments. His midterm and final are hard, but even after doing horribly on both, I got a B.",,
"So, yeah, this class is incredibly difficult. Most of it is done online so you don't really have to attend, but if you do, it's 3 hours of pain from how hard the material is and pain from how irrelevant his discussions are and how he constantly goes off topic. Other than that, just study for the midterm and final and do the term papers. You'll pass",,
"Let me just warn you: Even with his crazy curves this class is crazy hard!!! I am regretting every single moment of it.Take it next semester with a better professor if he is your last resort! Makes subject difficult and I don't understand on top of that why he finds it amusing to trick us. If class average is below 50, something is obviously wrong!",,
Lectures are irrelevant and very unclear. Exams are extremely difficult and unrelated to homework or lectures. Do not take this class. I got a B but it was the hardest B I ever earned. Take this professor as a last resort,,
"So confusing. I'm a junior and just received my first C. I highly recommend not taking him. He will give you old tests to study, they are of no use really. The questions on the tests will only resemble them but the actual material will be completely different. Professor Ng, please learn new methods of teaching. Also remember this is a 100lev class.",,
"Recipe for success from a NON-ECON MAJOR - in other words, someone who wants to pass - take the hybrid class, don't go to lectures except for quiz dates, do all of the online work, do the fairly simple term paper and exams - bam, you've passed. some questions he uses on tests are hard but c'mon he's not that bad. I love his off topic rants lmao.",,
I learned a lot from Dr. Ng. The lectures were interesting with many examples that relate to true life. The extra books were fun to read. I never knew much about life in China or Russia before taking the class.,,
"I did not learn anything from any of his lectures. He taught us how to get out of a DUI and witch doctors, but nothing about economics what so ever. The tests are impossible because none of the material is covered in any of the lectures. The average test score was a 30%",,
DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! His lectures are hard to follow and he goes off topic on these ridiculous examples. He does not apply the students for the assignments given and the live class is a waste of time. The work load is high and the grades don't reflect ones true knowledge of the material.,,
"It is mandatory to read the book for this class if you even want to pass! Most of his students fail but gives a big curve. Test are hard and confusing and don't resemble the HW. HW & Reading = Easy, Lecture & 3 Tests = Complicated.",,
"For the Love of your life do not take this professor, took him my first semester for 160 (micro-econ) and I passed with an A thanks to his term papers, but I decided to take him again for 160 (I had no choice thanks to my work schedule) and for 160 he HAD NO TERM PAPERS, unfortunately I failed! The way he explains ECON is incomprehensible!",,
This guy needs to be evaluated. His test scores and grades dont accurately reflect students knowledge in the course. Seriously dont waste your time taking a class by this guy.,,
He is a good professor. take his class if you want an A.,,
"Great class. You have to read 4 books plus the textbook but the extra books, the term paper, and the lectures really go all together and teach you something about the world. I believe the students who don't like this class are the ones who never got what Ng is trying to teach because they didn't really read all the books or do all the assignments.",,
"The tests are next to impossible and then extremely curved so that a 50 is an A. I got an A in the class and feel like I learned nothing. Anyone taking his class should be able to pass because of the huge curve. Lectures are vastly irrelevant to economics and at times borderline offensive, like explaining the best way to rob a small asian girl.",,
"Okay, he isn't the best teacher but there should be no reason to fail this class. The curve is huge & he gives many extra credit quizzes that are open book & you can work with others. The quizzes are the same concept of what is going to be on the exams. Yes, this class is pretty difficult for its level but it's college.. just study and ask for help",,
"Everyone passes because his grading system, but avoid if you want to learn about economics. His test very difficult and sometimes has information not referenced in class.",,
"His class is extremely difficult for a beginners Econ class. His lectures are 20% Econ 80% random nonsense. 1 midterm 2 papers 1 final. If you want to do well, read the book till you understand everything, get help from tutoring (even though tutors are just as confused sometimes), do all the homework, STUDY FOR THE QUIZES & study for the exams.",,
"If not for the curve, this semesters passing students would be less than 20,in a 200 student class.The curve ensures anyone who does at least one page of hw can pass, but if you plan to take the next courses (161, 300, etc) you will fail since you wont know the material that you were suppose to learn in 160",,
"The only reason I passed was b/c i had taken econ 161 before transferring.He goes off topic constantly that i ended up sleeping in class.He wont tell you what you missed and has that smirk of looking down on you for not knowing.I suggest that if you have not taken econ before and his is the last available class, wait another semester.Not worth it",,
HORRIBLE TEACHER! very hard quizes and exams. he doesnt teach well I sit all the way in the front and I still don't learn because he gets off topic so much... he's the only professor available for econ 161 next semester but I'm going to a community college just so I won't take him again. makes us read 4 books 1 of the books is over 500 pgs long!!,,
This dude cannot teach. He just talks the entire class and sometimes goes off on stories that have nothing to do with the topic. Take someone else if possible.,,
"When I read comments about this professor I was very nervous but had to take his class. Well, I really liked the way he taught this subject. It worked great for me to understand. You have to be patient and pay attention to understand his points. Those who are looking for an easy grade then do not take this professor. Loved his teaching style.",,
This class is a simple case of doing better than your peers. Everything is graded based on the whole class average. Do the homework it helps your grade. He makes you read 3 books!smh. 2 term papers on the books. His tests are so hard its ridiculous. Most of the time the average was around 30/100 and im not exaggerating.Take someone else if possible,,
I found that most people who complain about this professor simply didn't do their homework. Nor did they ask for help during his office hours. If you just do the homework (and its pretty simple stuff) the exams will be a breeze. Either way he grades on a pretty generous curve. If you just read your book it's almost impossible to get below a C.,,
"He's useless as a teacher but he grades on a curve. So you just have to do better than the rest of the class. Homework is done on Aplia, do it! It's the only way you can learn. (You have to be able to teach yourself the material and Aplia is the best way to do that). Don't get upset if halfway you have an F, grades change dramatically in this class",,
"Creeepy, and a terrible teacher",,
"AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!!
  
  I took Professor Ng last year and it was a big mistake. Lectures that ramble off topic, few references to the book and even with perfect attendance very little learned. This is what I got from Mr. Ng's class with near perfect attendance. 
  
  I wasn't alone as the majority of the class did poorly, which is why Mr. Ng grad",,
"I am about to graduate college next semester, never once have written a comment about one teacher here at CSUN, but this professor, by far, is the WORST. The average on all tests are F's if you want to pass this class with anything higher than a C avoid him. Did not open my text book once because the class had nothing to do with it!!!",,
If u cant teach yourself dont recommend this class his lectures confusing more than anything unless he goes off topic than interesting. Test extremely hard and not related to homework its like math with an essay test doesnt really make sense. Got a 32% on one test and did better than evryone sitting around me. dont recommend.,,
"He is absolutely incompetent, he does not teach properly which is why most of his class is failing and his tests are ridiculously hard. He gets off topic a lot and talks about poker and other stupid things...he does not teach so avoid this class for sure don't take it.",,
"Can anyone tell me how someone can be called a teacher when the average test scores are in the 50s and upper 40s&#63; He does not know how to teach which is why he uses a curve. As other's have said he often rambles on about poker, gambling and other personal interests. He was kindof creepy too. HE IS NOT A TEACHER. AVOID THIS GUY",,
He's hard and i dont like that. Love it when he brings ice cream into class. Our specail treat.,,
"I ranked in the top 2% of the class. Only like 5 people got higher grades than me. I studied a lot, read each chapter, did all homeworks and homework problems and still it was difficult. Hardest class ever taken so far in my collegiate career. i recommend taking this class If you hate Obama because you have to write essays about how bad Democrats R",,
"He encourages you not to tell your friends when a quiz is coming up, so as to increase the value of those additional points he applies to the test. He demonstrates an accurate depiction of just how bad the real world is really like...cheat your friends, be dishonest..and in the end win...profit...great grades. I loved this class. Go with it!",,
"He encourages you not to tell your friends when a quiz is coming up, so as to increase the value of those additional points he applies to the test. He demonstrates an accurate depiction of just how bad the real world is really like...cheat your friends, be dishonest..and in the end win...profit....I got an A while 100 or so people got Ds and Fs.",,
The WORST teacher EVER!!! He looks like shrek and his lectures are completely irrelevant to what he puts on the tests! but he can give some good advice.. on stuff that has nothing to do with econ,,
"The worst, I have nothing else to say about him.",,
"This class is difficult to keep attention during the lectures. Although the professor can be funny at times and a bit ridiculous. His exams are scored my weighted mean but you'll find out the mean is VERY low. Not a good teacher, I got A's on exams and ended up with a B. Even with perfect attendance.",,
"To give a heads up this class is challenging, but this professor does not make easier. His lectures are not clear, his test are extremely hard, and most of the times he gets into tangents that are point less, and it seems that he has something against students. The worst professor....AVIOD!!!",,
"ok this doosh's class really sucks. his pop-quizzes, all the exams and the final are irrelevant to the lectures. you never use the book. assigns an online HW system, which hes too lazy to give out HW and review anything. the class avg was below 65%. he sucks and he always has a gay ass smirk on his face. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS. U WILL REPEAT!!!!!!!",,
One word: AWFUL! He gives you previous lectures and exams so at first I thought it would be a peice of cake. I was WAY wrong. His lectures are pointless - he usually gets off topic talking about RANDOM things that have NOTHING to do with econ. Never uses book. Writes his own examines and is very objective. Do not take this professor!,,
"Mr. NG, who hurt you&#63; your real life examples of econic applications are either depressing,or negative.when asked why he put a question on our midterm that wasnt in the material we learned from him he said &quot;because its a thinking class, not a regurtgitating class&quot;.He grades on a curve thank goodness it saved all our butts who were boarderline.",,
BAD TEACHER! STAY AWAY! THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY! STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,,
What a Joke of a class and professor. Justs reads of slides. Im not even sure he know the material himself. Prepare to get a bad grade and waste your time with him,,
"Interesting lectures, but extremely hard grader and course. I attended every single lesson, did all my homeworks and quizzes and took all 3 exams, I still get a C. Compare as much effort as I put into other classes, I feel I deserve a better grade... If your aim is to pass with a nice grade, I suggest not to take this class. Good luck.",,
STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS CLASS AS POSSIBLE!,,
Do not take his class. I cannot think of a more useless professor.,,
if you want a passing grade DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!! it is the worst class i have everr taken at Csun. His lectures have nothing to do with his tests. He gradess soo hard that the highest grade in the class was a D on a test. even with him curving i failed. He talks about non sense sometimes that doesnt even regard econ.,,
If most of the comments say DO NOT TAKE HIM! its for a reason! So save your self a headache and don't take him. He is the one of the worse professors in csun!,,
"It's a challenging course but impossible to fail..does random pop quizzes which count as extra credit so go to class and take your notes!Just READ, do all your homework and you'll do fine",,
The worst class i have ever taken. Does not lecture about the topic of the day and test are VERY UNCLEAR AND LONG,,
"Do not, do not, do not take this professor unless you want to fail. His lectures are about gambling in Vegas & purchasing a car, his exams are so hard that are not even worth trying.",,
Most people come to this site because they are only interested in getting the easiest professor. They don't care about what they're or they are too stupid to understand anything. Prof. Ng is a good professor but you have to study.,,
test questions have nothing to do with lectures. he might know a lot about econ but he is not a teacher. avoid,,
worst teacher at csun. avoid taking him. test questions have nothing to do with the lecture. test questions are very missleading. you do not know if he wants you to answer questions by using the graphs or by using the text on the test.,,
the material was very interesting but he needed to slow down. he did not care about the students. he never wanted to answer questions and when someone would ask a question he would just give a fast answer and continue with his lecture-lecture was just reading/going over the powerpoints as fast as he could.,,
"NOT AS BAD AS EVERYONE SAYS HE IS! The people here giving him low ratings are just dumb asses who won't graduate CSUN. Attendance is not mandatory, but he gives extra credit quiz's which will boost your test scores by a full grade! He curves huge! Final 55%=B. You must do the homework to pass this class because it brings your grade up.",,
dont take!,,
"If you can't manage to get through one of his classes with at least a B, you should really consider changing major. His expectations are as clear as anyone's. He provides you all of the means to succeed. His lectures are informative, entertaining and brief. He doesn't subscribe to PC nonsense. He says what the evidence concludes. Excellent!",,
By far the worst teacher I ever had. AVOID taking his class if you can. He will tell you the first day 75% of you will fail and he's not joking. What do they say...&quot;those who can't teach&quot; he's one of them.,,
By far the worst teacher I ever had. AVOID taking his class if you can. He will tell you the first day 75% of you will fail and he's not joking. What do they say...&quot;those who can't teach&quot; he's one of them. He's a mess and should get a real job. Learn how to teach ECON NG - I got an A when I retook your class with a good teacher. Lose some LBS,,
"Professor Ng makes me think less of CSUN as a whole. If the Econ department lets him keep teaching - how can they possibly be concerned with the quality of their students learning experience&#63; He was NOTHING LESS than OFFENSIVE with comments that degraded women and overweight people. I think he may seriously need help teaching, he just cant do it!",,
one of the easiest class. got an A. he gives he extra credit on all the midterms by giving out quizzes. quizzes can raise your score on the midterms as much as 15 percent. just do all his online hwk. read the chapters when he assigns them and review his slides before the tests and you should receive an A. plus his curves mean 70% on test is an A,,
Class was fairly easy. attendance was not required but gives you about 2 extra credit quizzes randomly for each midterm and the final. so be at class and take those quizzes and it could raise your test grade by a letter. just read the chapters and study his slides and you'll do fine. he also curves. 72 percent earned an A on one midterm,,
this guy cant teach..he shows pictures of stupid cars and purses..his tests have nothing to do with the homeworks..he didnt even know when the final was all he said was just look online..the material is hard and it takes a good prof for a person to a understand it and this guy just sucks..avoid him,,
"Grades at a major curve. Gives test points from quizzes so go to class all the time, free points. Do all on-line work, open book, and easy points too. I got an A on line, a C on 1st test, F on 2nd test, and a C on final, and a C in the class. If you study, you can easily get a B, B+!",,
"Class hard with the pwerpoint slides. Textbook and quiz are with an online book. Completed homework REALLY important for grade. Answer come from online book,(you can print out) I suggest buy the hard back book to use for the online homework. Home points add up. Teacher not that great however show up for pop quizs do home work and you will pass.",,
"Boring long lectures that have more to do with stupid random examples about gambling, cars, and Fatburger. It's not that hard of a class though, because the curve means a 65 to 70% on the tests = an A. Go to class because he gives out extra credit pop quizes that really help your grade. Do the aplia homework and print out power point slides.",,
This is the worst teacher by far i have seen in my life! I mean all he does is ****ing read from the slides! **** i can do that at home as well why should i come to your class! Waste of time and money! I don't know who the **** gave him a job as a teacher he should find something else to do for a living. DON'T TAKE HIM PLEASE IF YOU LOVE YOURSELF!,,
I had this prof. in 1992. I CANNOT believe he hasn't changed. It was the worst class I have ever taken. I am a 4.0 student and he was the only C I have ever received in my life. I am now a teacher and know what good teaching is all about. He is one of the worst teachers I have ever experienced!,,
"omg this professor is freaking easy, yes his tests are sorta tricky but you just need to know how to BS your way thru the exams. I got a D on the 1st test, A on thn 2nd and A on the final. You dont even need to show up to class. Just review his ppt and you're good. and do good on the quizes",,
make sure you do well on the HW it really helps your grade.,,
"by far the worst teacher. all he do is read the powerpoint. U dont learn anything in his class. if u want to learn, dont ake his class",,
"He is the hardest Econ teacher i ever had. His tests are so hard that when he curves, his 50% is a B. You don't learn anything in his class, and end up with the grade that u do not want, so please think about it before u take this professor. I passed with C barely, but I did not enjoy or learn anything from it.",,
worst teacher EVER. don't take him unless you want to retake the course.,,
"I'm not a business major but i really enjoyed this class. It was frustrating doing the assignments before the lectures, but overall I learned a lot from this class. Show up, do all the homework, take the quizes, and yes, you will need to actually study for this class, but you'll do well and it will be well worth it.",,
"HE IS ONE OF THE WORST PROFESSORS EVER. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. HE DOESN'T TEACH ANYTHING IN CLASS, JUST READS OFF POWERPOINTS AND HIS EXAMS ARE NOT RELATED TO HIS LECTURES AT ALL. HE GIVES POP QUIZZES THAT COUNT TOWARD YOUR EXAM, BUT OVERALL ITS A TOUGH CLASS",,
BEST ECON PROF AT CSUN. He'll teach you how to 1. Solve World Hunger with Economics 2. Cheat in Pool/Vegas 3.And a whole lot about economics. The Aplia assignments online are tough but if you come to each class he gives you EXTRA CREDIT QUIZZES that count towards the tests. Her curbs the tests too. I got an A! 2 Midterms + 1 Cumulative Final.,,
Very helpful teacher. Illustrative lectures. Friendly. Scores based on curves.,,
He's not interactive in his lectures; they are more like presentations. He often spends too much time on his irrelevant examples. Stay the whole class and U will be rewarded with pop quizzes that R added to the tests. U can keep the quiz & get the answers online. Most questions on the quizzes are on the tests. The curve is GREAT. Do the homework!,,
the worst teacher i have ever had at this school. he does not know how teach and he is the hardest grader.,,
"Whatever you do, make sure you don't get stuck with this guy!!! He is the WORSE professor !!! Very boring, he goes off on topics that are completely irrelevant to what he is teaching, he mumbles when speaking. I did not learn anything in his class and on top of that the exams were extremely hard and made no sense. He should not be teaching.",,
"This guy is brilliant. out of 150 students, 50% failed. 50% never showed up to lectures. This also explains the ratings here. His lectures are entertaining. His exams are a bit long, but the curve is amazing. 40% a C&#63; out of 100 questions! people that failed deserved to fail",,
"GOOD LUCK! 3 tests (including final), and a few extra credit quizzes (you'll need it). Attendance does not matter, however if you miss quiz day you don't get any extra credit points. He talks more about random things than he does the material. Stay at average &quot;standard deviation&quot; and pray for a C.",,
"Dont miss the first day of class, he gives out HW on the first day and if you miss it you wont be able to make it up. Class is real easy to pass, the curve is pretty relaxed",,
"Don't miss any quizzes(count as extra credit)& download all ppt slides individually. Do complete all APLIA HW with other classmates. Practice any old quizzes including final, and ask Kenny lots of &#63;s. Lectures are confusing. With a consistent study group, a disciplined mindset, and an awsome curve, I earned a &quot;B&quot; and learned a lot in the process.",,
"horrible teacher !!...cant teach for sh*t, lectures are sooo boring, he always goes off on tangents, talking about stuff that doesnt relate to the material at all. i guarantee u wont last his 3hour lectures...exams are unbeleivably hard...DONT take this guy",,
He is by far the worst professor ever! He's very unclear with class lectures. He's test includes graphs that doesn't exlain itself. He doesn't offer extra help outside of class. Don't waste your time and money with this professor.,,
The worst professor EVER. I got an 'A' on the cumulative final and he gave me a 'C' in the class. Marked off points on the midterm for going too much into detail...&#63;!&#63;!..,,
"The tests are extremely difficult-all graphs with explanation. Huge curve makes it possible to pass, but not with a lack of effort. I found the material impossible to understand, and the lectures very boring!",,
No Comments,,
"Very difficult tests, for he doesn't make clear what he really wants; he is not helpful. The Guy knows his deal but expects the student to be at his level. Aplia doesn't help for the exams. Take him if you have your econ down. The class is interesting.",,
"Worthless teacher. Be prepared to teach yourself the material. Lectures get way off the subject, and end up falling far behind. I skipped the majority of the classes and still pulled a high C. Has massive curves for all the assignments and tests.",,
"Attend class everyday and listend to lecture. The lectures are not that bad and it is usually funny stuff. Exams are hard no joke; however, there is a curve but still don't forget to do the aplia assignment and do your best..Overall, he is a good professor but still hard.",,
"His curve is so steep, usually a fail on an exam curves to an &quot;A.&quot; There is extra credit almost every week. Great lectures, very helpfull in his office hours. If you take him and GO TO CLASS you should have no problem getting an A. I have learned more from him than any other teacher at the school.",,
"The only reason this guy gets low ratings is because people are STUPID. His lectures are great, very interesting and usually comical. he gives extra credit almost every week, and the curve... My dog could score above his curve. He curves the class using people who never took it, giving them all zeroes. Listen to the lectures, he is so fair and easy",,
"all the ratings with 5's are bs. they all same the same ish. &quot;dont read book, lectures funny, study online quizzes&quot; dude rates himself. sad sooo sad...",,
be aware of teachers rating themselves. some extra good comments sound fishy.,,
"Good class. I learned a lot. Had Ng for Econ. 160 so I was used to the exams and the way he teaches.
  I reccomend any of Ng's classes. They are all pretty good.",,
"If you like &quot;C's&quot; this is your teacher. If you want an &quot;A&quot; or a &quot;B&quot;, do not take him. Unfair grader, took off ALOT of points from my test for &quot;going into too much detail&quot;...&#63;&#63;&#63; The WORST teacher ever!",,
"teaches this class EXACTLY like 310 (tells the same stories too). nothing new to learn. his grading is all, little or nothing. he is delusional about exam performances, claiming no responsibility for clearly abysmal class average (exam 2). u have to understand (predict) the way he thinks to answer test q's - do that, get A. only +, pure curve.",,
"Tests do not go with the homework, book or the notes. Grades very harsh and unfair. By far worst teacher ever, does not respond to e-mails.",,
Good class. I learned a lot. Lectures are interesting and the curve on the exams makes the grading pretty easy. You have to study though to pass.,,
"I loved this class. I got an A. Don't read the book. Just study the notes, listen to what Ng says in class, and make sure you do all the online assignments. You learn a lot that way.",,
"Good course. Ng is pretty funny in class. The extra credit assignments are a big help. If you go to class and read the book, the class is pretty east. I learned a lot in the class.",,
If youre good at math/econ the material isnt hard.The problem is he has a system of surprise quizzes that add free points to the exams.That and the homework destroy the curve for people who don't need to sit through his slideshows which are online anyway.Apparently his pet theme-survival of the fittest-doesnt mean survival of the smartest.**Lame**.,,
all i can say is WORST csun professor ever.,,
"the worst prof i've ever had at csun. his lectures are completely unclear and he was so demeaning one day in class, i walked out and never went back.",,
Dr ng was pretty interesting for an econ professor. interesting stories... tests were on point for what he discussed,,
he was crazy for put the powerpoint.Never interested and so tough exam. Best curve systme that you are able to get C if you get above 30 point out of 100 in any test,,
This has to be one of the worst teachers at csun. The guy is the most boring and unhelpful teacher i have come across. If you and needed econ and if every other class was full and his was open i would wait a semester and take another teacher. All the good ratings came from nerd asians like him.RUN,,
"The online course was good. The lectures were pretty interesting and the exams were straightforward---if you looked at the old exams on the website. There were a lot of good examples in the lectures.Don't read the book. You don't need it if you use the recorded lectues, online quizzes,exam bank.",,
"If you can take any other teacher instead of Ng, I HIGHLY recommend it. I have a 3.4 GPA and managed to fail his class. It was so bad that the curve was a 30% was a C!!! Do you think all of the students were stupid&#63; I think not! Ng is a joke of a teacher.",,
Great professor. The lectures were great. You have to study a lot to do well though.,,
"not very good professor, his lectures are boring and he does not teach. he is funny but that does not help in learning or passing the class. DO NOT TAKE HIM. TAKE SOMEONE ELSE. unless you want to fail.",,
His class is very interesting. He knows the subject well. But the exam is difficult and the on-line quizz is a waste-of-time.,,
Prof. Ng's econ 310 class was insanely hard. He was not only unhelpful but rude. His response to hearing and knowing that 2/3 of the class will get a D or lower was &quot;well its not my fault if students do not want to learn.&quot; I was able to pull off a passing grade in the class with lots of tutoring.,,
"do not take him for econ 310OL. horrible course. thank god the econ department has a different professor teaching it next semester. only 1 A out of 60 online kids, because he averages the online class with his regular class -they didnt get lectures with messed up audio.",,
He is a good teacher. Dont have to go to class. Just read the book (the boldface) and the graphs carefully and you will definately get an A on HIS tests.,,
The only reason people complain about him is that they are lazy and want to have everything handed on a silver platter. Just study and put effort into the class and you'll get an A. he's a great professor and makes class interesting. He's also willing to answer questions and help students.,,
"Anyone who gives bad feedback obviously didnt try, cause this class is pretty easy- I hardly went to class and just read the book and I got a B. Just TRY and I promise you'll get a good grade and the curve helps too.",,
Listen folks he grades on a curve. The competition is not that hard if you simply put effort into his once a week homework. He talks about stuff off the subject but its hilarious. Econ itself is really common sense but if it isn't he may seem a little ambigous.YouDoHaveToGiveAlittleEffortToGetanA,,
simple class - hw is really easy and is online - one 10 page paper at end - records all classes so you can download the powerpoint and lecture off the internet - tests are a multiple choice contain a mix of online hw and book - no attendance,,
"The class I took is part online so if you are going to take econ 160 and see only one day listed as class, then be warned, it is online. The class itself is not all the bad, just stay up with the readings, watch the lectures and go to class as much as possible. H e grades one a sick (good) curve.",,

"He's to smart to be a teacher, and unfortunately it causes him to teach over our head.",,
"THIS CLASS COULDNT GET ANY WORSE, STAY AS FAR AS YOU CAN FROM THIS TEACHER",,
This is a nightmare! I am a junior and do not have one c or lower on my transcript and am failing this class! How did he become a teacher. I can't warn you enough- stay away from this teacher!!!,,
if you don't want to screw up your gpa don't take the online class. This professor sucks... i will not recommend himto anyone. watch out...,,
The Midterm was pretty easy. MC straight out of the boook. Anyone who didn;t well obviosly didn't study much. The curve was pretty forgiving too. Only 70% needed for an A--which I got. :),,
Horrible Professor. I received a 34 on the mid term. After the curve this was a C. Homework given through the Aplia web-site did not apply to the text book.,,
"I don't know what the &quot;cooling off&quot; thing is, but the lectures are hilarious--going to class is like going to a comedy club. Besides, how hard can the lectures be&#63;--they are multiple choice right out of the book.",,
This guy should not be teaching. My advice to all of you: don't go along with that one week cooloing off period policy. We all deserve to be heard by our professors ANYTIME we have a problem. That's what we pay them for.,,

He is a funny guy if you can handle sarcasim! Study hard though!,,
"I actually liked him, got an A, pretty funny too.",,

"this guy is one of the biggest idiots alive. he mumbles about a lot of crap as he goes on and expects u to know everything. you ask him a question its like cursing at him he gets ticked off. he is HARD! he curves the class just so people pass, a monster.",,
"He is the worst professor I have ever had. Refuses to help anyone. Luckily for the curve, the class is passable but other than that, this guy is an idiot!",,
"refuses to teach. Answer is reight word for word, but he marks wrong because graph is off. On his slide he has &quot;Standard one week cooling off period after the test&quot; before he will talk to you.",,
"He's really funny, but the team-teaching/part online setup was very bad.",,
STAY AWAY. nothing he says makes sense! talks more about vegas and bikes then econ. lectures suck- all on powerpoint with him reading it line by line. you should skip econ for a semester if he's your last choice. Aplia homework take tooo long!!!,,
"econ 310 and 311 have the worse passing rates, people like NG, are the reason why. even though class is curved. HE MAKES IT SO HARD. i wouldn't recommend.",,
Tests are WAY TOO LONG in a short amount of time.. No calculators for simple calculations which really slow you down. Says &quot;Ok&quot; After Everyother Word which can be REALLY annoying to have to listen to.. Wouldnt Really Recommend Him.. He is nice,,
"he usually teaches big classes, but his test are HARD. he curves, which means if you are smart, and work hard, you'll be fine. if you are looking for a easy way out, i wouldn't recommend him",,
hard tests but curve is fair ended up with A but a lot of work to get the A,,
Fascinating class! I learned so much about US history! Ng's really alot of fun.,,
passing rate are low,,
DO NOT TAKE THIS GUY!!! You will regret it. I consider myself a pretty smart person. With the right teacher and minimum efforts...I can get a &quot;B&quot; in any class... but not this one. I would have received fails on both test if it werent for the cur,,
"Real difficult. His lectures have nothing to do with his lame, unnecessary difficult tests. If it wasn't for his big curve 80% of the class would have failed. 47 out of 100 was a B for me. Think about it and stay away from this horrible guy.",,
"One of the best professor's one can hope for. Not easy, but if you don't miss his classes and pay close attention to his lectures you'll do fine. You learn a lot.His lectures are very interesting unlike many other professors' who put me to sleep.",,
"If you are receiving your PHD in economics, then you might have a chance of getting a C in this class. His evil laugh reminds you of the wicked witch, except in this case you replace the W with a B. And just remember, NO CHANCE, thats what you've got!",,
hard tests... hard assignments.. hard essay questions. BUT NICE BIG CURVE at the end.,,
Stay focused and you will do fine. Don't miss assignments or points will be deducted from your grade. But the homework and quizzes help you. Do them and you can't go wrong.,,
"Professor asks oddball exam questions that makes it difficult, if not impossible, to apply concepts learned in class. WORST teacher I've ever taken. Class average were approximately 38%. I got a 47% on Exam 2, which was an A. Very subjective grading.",,
No Comments,,
"Very nice guy, speaks in a monotone voince and every other word is &quot;um.&quot; Tests are rather difficult, just use the CD that came with the book and you'll do fine. Has some very funny lectures about cars, woman's clothes, counter-strike, etc.",,
Pop quiz & HW help back up your grade. And you can officially work on quiz with classmate.,,
"Don't take this guy. Trust me, STAY AWAY FROM NG.",,
"Talks about Koreans and their gambling habits, Vietnamese and their donut shops, and dont forget he talks about the Cambidians and their liquor stores and how they do online blackjack while watching directv. ALL OF THIS IS TRUE ABOUT NG.",,
"Do not take him! Does not care about students and never clearly explains what he wants. He ridicules you instead about your paper, and rarely ever teaches. You will have to teach yourself.",,
One of the best prof in the Psych dept. He does care about everyone passing. Yes there are a lot of assignments but they are do-able. He is passionate about what he teaches and he will meet you half way if you actually try in his class. If you take things to the heart don't take him. I have had him for 2 classes already and will take him again.,,
"If you want a professor who cares about you passing DO NOT TAKE HIM. He demeans you for asking a question, doesn't give instruction on what he wants for the research paper but will get mad if you don't follow his nonexistent instructions, wont answer emails or any questions, his 'sassy' comments are insults, and you have to teach yourself. AVOID!!!",,
He gets off topic a lot during lectures or he brings up topics that have no importance that makes the chapter more confusing. He can be funny but I understand how he can come off as rude. He gives a lot of assignments but let's you do them in class with groups. He lets you redo your exam to add onto your score which brings up your exam grade!,,
"the good: funny, works with you every step of the way, gives good feedback. the bad: blunt and borderline rude (he might be too much if you take criticism personally), semi-disorganized structure of the class (when was that deadline again?), unnecessary lectures (all he does is read off powerpoints). be ready for independent studying.",,
"if you anticipate this class being difficult for you then be prepared to learn material independently. otherwise, this may be an easy A for you depending on how well you do on his exams. drops lowest exam, doesn't assign much hw, no extra credit opportunities, teaching style is very relaxed,forgets to post ppt slides sometimes so take notes or read",,
"He is nice, but VERY DISORGANIZED. Mid-term NO ONE PASSED! So he let us retake the test but with open book and in groups. Most of everybody studied for the test, but some questions were not clear and from chapters we haven't even seen or talk in class. He gave us credit for those questions. But I sincerely do not recommend this professor.",,
"The professor really has spider senses when you are off task (example on your phone) and he will call you out on it. Yes, he is sassy, but his class was great. We learned a lot, we laughed a lot and our exams were fairly easy. You just have to study.",,
Funny sassy guy! Lectures are long but okay. He is easy. 3 tests and drops the lowest grade. He let's us share our personal experiences making the class funner.,,
"Dr. Abara is a really fun and kind professor, some people might need to get used to his sassy personality, but he's a very fair grader and gives you the answers to the tests in his lectures. He keeps you awake and interested by cracking hilarious jokes, and genuinely cares about class feedback. Pay attention in class and try, and you'll get an A.",,
DONT use your cell phones. if you have a laptop with you don't look at it often. make sure to pay attention to him more because 1. you will pass. 2. he has spider senses when someone is doing something else. great professor highly recommend.,,
This professor is amazing! Just dont get on his bad side because he would put you on the spot. Respect him by not texting in class. He is a good professor and i recommend you taking him. He inspired me to become a psy major. He has funny jokes and does not want to see his students fail.,,
"You can tell that he's a great guy, and his sense of humor was geeky and I loved it with every lecture. With that said, his lectures are long and usually quite disorganized. There's only 3 exams throughout the class though, so there's little room for error. Even so, he takes the best 2 grades into account, discarding the 3rd. Difficult exams.",,
"he can be monotone when he's not being hilarious. 2 midterms & 1 cumulative final, consists of commonly missed questions from previous 2. attendance is 10%, other 90% are exams + the psych project. really easy and straightforward, clear expectations. he'll give you a verbal study guide for exams, study that and youll be fine. you dont need thetext",,
"If you have half a brain, you'll take notes during lectures and do well on the tests. Not sure what all the other comments are about, one of my favorite professors at CSUN. Taught me a lot that I've used in grad courses.",,
"His tests are more based on his lectures than the book (which he told the class several times) its important to take notes on what he says. He can be stern if you piss him off, but he tries to lighten his lectures with jokes so i found it easy to follow.",,
Hard class but loved him!,,
I really was excited about taking this class and I left hating it. I would never take him again. His tests are extremely hard and idk where the questions are coming from. Not based on the textbook or lecture thats for sure. Ended up with a B and thats because everyone was doing so bad that he did an open book final but that won't save ur grade,,
I was very disappointed in taking him for this class. He was referred by another student who spoke highly of him. He is not funny; he is condescending. He does not lecture. He comes in when he feels like it and then makes up some excuse. His tests are hard because he puts material that we have not been covered by him or in the text book.,,
Him being funny wears off after a week. I went into this class knowing it was hard & read all the chapters taking extensive notes & got C's on both exams. He curved not because we didn't study but because he messed up. On the 2nd of 3 exams he threw out 10q's because there was no way of us knowing them they literally were not in the booknotes!,,
"Great Professor, doesn't want to see you fail unless you really deserve to. Recognizes that the course material is rigorous and tries to ease the pain by offering open note test; at least that was the case in my experience.",,
"Dr. Abara SAVED my semester! I was terrified to take PSY321 because math is just not my thing, but he was so helpful and always willing to go out of his way for you as long as you put the effort in. Loved his class so much, I signed up for his Capstone. Takes hard work and effort, but you'll def be glad you took him for this kind of class.",,
One of the best professors at CSUN would definitely take his class again.,,
Actually cares about students and willing to go the extra mile.,,
A great professor. knowledgable. Would definitely take him again.,,
I really enjoyed his class and would definitely recommend him!,,
"SO HARD. Yeah he tells you 1/2 questions on test, but so many people still failed. When reviewing test q's, he had trouble with knowing the answers. Maybe 15 EC pts., on about 2 exams (bc drops worst) at 100 pts. ea. @ 50 questions. Lectures goes off topic, emails ppt., but asks very specific questions. Very little textbook used. Strict on cell use",,
GOOD LUCK because thats exactly what you need to even get a B in that class. My god is he a bad teacher. You will leave the class learning absolutely nothing and with a lower gpa. Thank you abara.,,
"Abara is amazing!Yes,can get off topic but knows his stuff and knows it WELL. Some people may think he's mean but you just have to get his personality. Tests are difficult but this is college so I honestly don't know why people complain about it. If you're actually interested in LEARNING take him! He's always willing to clarify what you don't get.",,
"he is somewhat funny, but he often gets off topic. the class consisted of 2 midterms and a final. he drops the lowest score and let us use notes on the day of the final because the class average was pretty low. Dont forget to do the 'sona' activities of you wont pass the class. Also, make sure to attend lecture and take thorough notes!",,
He practically tells you what he is going to put on the test and makes sure that you understand the material. He is very strict on not using your phone in class but this helps you concentrate in class. Class attendance is practically mandatory since he gives surprise extra credit.,,
worst teacher in my three years in college. He is very RUDE. I thought he was funny in the beginning too. Until I noticed his jokes consisted calling out students and insulting them. In addition to this his tests questions come from no where. Even if you read the book twice and attend lectures u will do bad on his tests. It horrible. Never again.,,
"This guy is hilarious! Yes, he would get somewhat distracted, but taught very well. He went over the test materials before the tests, gives lots of extra credit, and drops the lowest test score. Such an easy class and I learned a lot! Recommend him for sure!",,
"I watched some of my friends struggle in the class, but it was of how distracted they were with their phones and talking to other people. In order to get an A in the class, you really need to pay attention in his lecture, you dont need the book. Theres only 3 tests, and he drops the lowest score. all the answers are literally from his lecture",,
he is great! very funny! his test are straight forward if you study. everything is based off his notes. he can have his boring moments but it's not a difficult class.,,
He really doesn't care about his students and it shows. Always makes fun of people and talks about himself. To top it off his tests are harder than any test from my upper division courses. I really was looking forward to taking this class and now I am just happy its done with.,,
"Great prof. He really helps you boost your grades on exams by trying to find ways to give you extra points.Two midterms and final. Makes the final so easy that its impossible not to get an A on the final. Mostly lecture and powerpoint based exams, sometimes heÛªll have it from the book if he hasnÛªt covered the material yet.",,
"Abara is very intelligent and truly wants you to learn. This class isnt an easy A, but if you care about your grade and go to the professors office hours now and then you will get an A in the class. Go to every class because he will offer extra credit and take role randomly. Overall great guy and professor. Take notes & pay attention you'll do fine",,
terrible professor. Does not teach. Just talks to the class in an inconsistent and unclear manner. Does not take the time to clarify. Goes off topic. Questions on exams are random and hard. I am a straight A student and feel like I will fail his class. DO NOT TAKE HIM!!!!!!,,
Terrible professor. Does not teach. Just talks to the class in an inconsistent and unclear manner. Does not take the time to clarify anything. Goes off topic. Questions on exams are random and hard. I am a straight A student and feel like his class is the only class I will fail. Everyone does bad on his tests. DO NOT TAKE HIM!!!!!!,,
Not recommended! You will always be lost in class. Goes on tangents. Covers barely anything in a longgg class and expects you to go read about it for the exam. Not easy to pass and won't know what your grade is the whole time. It's horrible.,,
He is horrible at getting through class material and tries to cram everything in one class session before the exam. Exams will have random questions about things never covered. Many people do horrible on the tests. There's no other assignments except the exams. Attending class is important only for random points. Not recommended!,,
"Best Professor on the whole campus! You will feel confident that you learned the material. Excellent presentation, thank you for inspiring me in the field of Psychology!",,
He is the worst teacher I have ever had. He calls out people to embarrass them and manages to do this every class. I do not know how he is a psychologist. Clearly does not care about anyone. Creates a very hostile environment. Half the class failed his 1st test. Gives e.c. but assigns questions that are hard to answer so no one gets credit.,,
"Loved him! People just like to hate or be a smart mouth. If you're one of those two, please don't even bother taking his class cause he doesn't put up with peoples crap. He was very helpful and he sincerely loves what he does and wants his students to succeed. And he's hilarious!",,
"I don't understand why his rating is so low. He is an amazing professor. He made class enjoyable and was very knowledgable. He could always answer questions about what your career would require and gave tips as well. 2 papers, not hard at all, and a 20 question final (EASY).",,
"He is an amazing professor! He makes lectures interesting and explains the material over if you don't understand. 3 tests, only counts 2. Final is cumulative from the 1st & 2nd exam. Gives some extra credit but does it randomly so you HAVE to attend class. ALWAYS tells you what to know for the exams. Take him!",,
Great professor! I really recommend you to take him! The class might be hard but the professor is very helpful! And he makes it easy for you! Just concentrate in class and do not text!! Trust me!,,
Great Professr.,,
"Was a bit behind on lessons. I felt overwhelmed towards the end of the semester just because there was new information being thrown at me just days before the final exam. But I think he is a kind man and wants the best for his students. His lectures are entertaining and clear. Show up to class, make sure you listen, and DO NOT TEXT. You'll be fine!",,
He is nice man and i love his class. Not homework and quiz !!! you only need to take 3 big exam in the whole session. Try to be a good student and you will not have any problem,,
"He is funny and makes us laugh, and always makes jokes. He is also very helpful. He is really a great professor! Scandilish! Just do your best and you will do just fine.",,
I love Abara. I took him for 320 and knew i needed him for 321. He helped us with our research which was great and was awesome at giving us the resources we needed. He is supportive and wants his students to do well and it's easy to do so.,,
"I'm a pretty dedicated student so to say this guy was a challenge would be accurate. STUDY PAST TESTS. He reuses questions. I got an A by doing so, by reviewing what he taught and DO NOT MISS CLASS. Most of his material is taught in class by lectures. He gives power points out but he fills them in (the answers) during the class by mouth. Just GO.",,
Dr. Abara is one of the best teachers on campus. He is very knowledgeable and he genuinely cares about his students. I highly recommend his class. Not taking his class would be a big mistake!!! Thank you Dr.Abara for two semesters of excitement and fun!!! You are truly the best. Capish ?,,
"he is arrogant and has anger management issues. He seems nice and funny but soon you realize that he is stalling so as to not teach. If you want to learn, do not take his class. He falls way behind his syllabus, grades unfairly and talks down to students who ask challenging questions.",,
"Dr. Abara was hilarious!! I felt like I sat through a stand up comedy show every time I attended class. If you put effort into this class, he will put the effort back. I found him to be very fair with his grading. Just do what he tells you and you will be fine! The homework is completely manageable from the lab. I'd recommend him! :]",,
"Dr. Abara is a great professor. He truly does have an interest in the success of his students as long as you follow his simple instructions, which is show up for class and while in class pay attention to lecture. Most importantly do not use your cellphone, which makes sense because YOU are in CLASS! Soooo you can't learn while texting...SIMPLE!!",,
"I had professor Abara for PSY 301 during the Spring 2012 semester. I found him entertaining even though he was hard on attendance, but he was still great! He does come to class late- sometimes 30 minutes late which is a BIG problem! For PSY 301 he assigned 3 papers: your short-term goals, long-term goals, and field of interest.",,
"He is the best teacher!! If you are willing to put in the work and care about your grade, he will be there to help you succeed! He is really funny too! Take good notes and read what he tells you to read--you will do well!",,
This professor lost 3 out of 6 of my tests. Luckily I had proof of my tests or else I would have gotten an F. Plus he was such a hassle the whole break and almost the whole next semester to change my grade.,,
Professor Abara was a great teacher. His class was a good pace and very entertaining and easy to understand.,,
Great explanations. Professor is good at explaining and getting the whole class involved. Class was fairly easy just be sure to attend classes and on time.!,,
"Very knowledgeable & entertaining professor. The class does require effort, tests are difficult, but he's generous with test grading. Book was useful as a supplement to his lecture notes, therefore class attendance is crucial. Overall a great professor.",,
"He is funny, but unclear. I had him for 301, a 1-unit class and it felt like a 3-unit class with all the papers that were due. I would not recommend him. Unclear and unreliable.",,
Abara is the best! He does his best to make the class interesting by being funny and trying to relate to relevant social topics. If you show effort and ask him what you can do to pass the class he will help you out so much. His test are extremely easy if you are attentive during lecture. I would happily take him for Psy 301!,,
"Doctor Abara was a great professor,his PSY 250 class was easy if you pay attention &take notes on his lectures. He reviews a lot, which was, it helped me further understand if I didn't get it the first time. He does his best to be understanding, and for that he is awesome. Enjoyed his class a lot and passed with an A without the text.",,
Dr. Abara is very passionate about his subject but unreliable. He walks into the 50 minute class 10 minutes late and isn't clear about what is required of the students. Class is unorganized and he says he will help but doesn't show up to office hours or do what he says he will.,,
"Dr. Abara is hilarious. He gives really hard exams...I would say impossible exams...but he lets you bring up your grade a lot!! He does not reply to emails, but is nice in class.",,
"Dr. Abara is one of the coolest professors i've had at northridge. The class itself wasn't all that interesting, but he made it kinda fun. He's really funny and really does try to do everything to help you pass the class if you ask. He's awesome, i would definitely take another class with him. also, he's a seriously sharp dresser. classy guy.",,
"He is funny but not a very good teacher, the only reason to take him is for a credit/no credit class. Attendance is mandatory..No hw. Very easy class since it is credit/no credit, HATES when people use their cell phones so do not text in there!!!",,
"I LOVE ABARA!!!! He is hilarious and super smart. He is such a cool guy and easy to talk to. If you need anything, he is there. He is clear about what is on the test but the student needs to make sure that they understand the concepts in stats to do well because he challenges his students to evaluate and use critical thinking. You need him! lol",,
I am really upset by all this negativity on Dr. Abara's page. The people hating on him probably didn't even study or come to class. His class is challenging and if you don't abuse his rules then there is no problem. Have some respect! The ones who wrote negative commentary should take an English class because your spelling sucks!,,
"If you like learning and having a good time at the same time, take Dr. Abara. He is amazing! He knows his stuff and incorporates humor or easy examples for a better understanding of the material. He cares about his students and always wants to know if you are struggling so that he can help you. I have taken him again and again because he ROCKS!",,
"I took Abara for the seminar section of 473 in the summer, not the lecture part. He's really funny, and tries to be engaging. We have a research paper but since it was the summer, he gave us all the data and the methods. We just really needed to find references. 10% is also showing up, but you get to dissect brains which is fun.",,
One of the best out there!,,
He is the worst Professor EVER. Super unfair and careless. I took two classes with him cuz didnt have any option and learned absolutely nothing. Do not waist you time!!,,
Dr. Abara is simply AMAZING!!! His class is informative and he definitely does not bore you. He is super funny and very intelligent. Previous to taking 473 I had second thoughts about taking him by looking at his reviews on rate my professor but I am so glad that I did not listen and it was a pleasure being one of his students. It is a 400 level cl,,
Show up every day and understand what he is saying and you can get an A. Very funny! :) This is a class you WILL HAVE to study for!,,
I loved his class! He was so funny and notes really helped for the test he gave which anyone can pass if they study the book and notes he gave in class. Also made sure you got your experiment credits done. Was a great help!,,
"Great class, it was a Friday class but well worth it. We did group test, there are 6 test but are only 20 questions each and he drops your lowest grade. He is very funny and makes the class interesting.",,
Great Pofessor. This was a friday class but still very enjoyable. He told lots of jokes. we took goup tests and had a take home test. The final was all questions from previous test. He is an awesome profesor and I would highly reccommend taking him!!,,
"Taking His classes are big danger! Very confusing lecture,(unrelated slides with unrelated lectures are mixed to make you nervious) very complicated tests.",,
"It seems that Dr Abara has been burn out. search &quot;burnout in caring professionals&quot; to know what I say. He IS really a nice and compassionate person.But, His teaching is disaster! his tests are disaster!",,
I ahve really missed his sayings &quot;happy hour...As such...seretonin...&quot; He was nice,,
"You know what&#63; He does really have a good heart. If you get to like him, He undrestand kindness. I have really missed him, my tears came out after leaving class today.He does want to help students",,
"he compares his job to customer service, , BUT, the class is really self service!you need to kills your self to learn. talks about difficult concepts of pharmacology A lot of medication names that you cannot even remember.like you say to 10 years old child: we have short term memory and long term memory .tests very hard. great risk if you take him!",,
"You either really ignore the risk you are facing by being in his class, or really don't care about the situation. Biology must not be taught like sociology that you just write down and memorize.the materials are not presented in a conceptual way.",,
"Very detailed on every aspect that he teaches. Tests will definitely test you. Fun class, makes it interesting. 3 tests, Group test for number 2. Must take notes to pass class material is not usually in the book. Ask him if you can help in his research. Everything on test was covered in lecture and he is very clear about that.",,
"He's actually a really good teacher, I don't know why so many people are hating. He's funny and gets along well with his students. 2 midterms and an optional final. Tests are hard, but our second midterm was a group test w/ open notes. If you're interested in the subject and want to learn, then he's a good teacher to take.",,
"Awful professor, Awful way of teaching, not clear, not nice with students",,
"He is illogical, Not helpful, extremely hard ( you do not learn any thing) Just unrelated hard master's level material, questions are as complicated as possible! AVOID HIS CLASS!",,
"Never never take his classes evenif the time matches your schedual! Go to evening classes, but Do NOT TAKE IT!",,
Very fun teacher. The test follow his lectures and the book and have very few surprises. If you take good notes and spend a some time studying the class is pretty easy. Keeps class very interesting so hopefully you won't get bored. He does have an accent but I had no trouble understanding him.,,

"Dr. Abara is very anal but he means well, honestly after reading these poor reviews on him i was terrified to go to class but he really was not that bad. His accent is thick and hard to understand. He makes reallly corny jokes and thinks that he is so funny and its exhausting! The material was difficult for me and his tests were extremely hard!",,
"Alright this is how it is with this man..he is brilliant and incredibly knowledgable. He will not waste his time on students who are at high school level. If you wish to learn/move on to grad school take him. Not for those skating by to buy a degree. Hello work for it people, what a concept. Anyhow he is an asset to CSUN and &quot;Valium&quot; is not needed.",,
He is an anal retentive and passive aggressive queen. He must be a nightmare as a coworker.Take a valume.,,
"His grading system is good. There is only one problem with this professor. It may sound that he cares about you as a student, but he does not. Just go to class, do the assignment and you will be ok. Just don't have high expectations.",,
one of the worst professors i have ever had. the tests are beyond ridiculous!! they are based on things he never even spoke of. bring him a diet coke and he might like you.,,
"If you do the work, ask questions, and show up to class, you'll get a good grade. This is a 400 level class, don't expect it to be easy. Put time into the class and you won't get a bad grade.",,
"Awful professor, not professional. Stay away!!!",,
"Great professor. It was discouraging to study for hours upon hours only to receive a fail on every exam but thankfully he curves them. He is very genuine and I never as if he was rude, just sarcastic - and it was funny and always appropriate! To be honest, the students were the ones that made fools of themselves. Recommend course for hard workers.",,
"Does not reply to e-mails, rude to students and seems way too worried about how students rate him on this site and on the CSUN evaluation sheet. Do not take him!",,
bad teacher. was over oppiniated. always late to class. would not respond to emails or acknowledge them even being sent. rude to students. stay away!,,
"I got an -A, and still think ge is not a good prof. Stay away if you can!",,
"I do not agree with some of the comments. I got an A and still did not like the way he teaches, plus I did not like the way he treated some students, I saw him being mean to other people and that really bothered me.",,
"I totally agree with the last comment. And I have to say I was in the top of the class as well, and still do not think he was a good professor, nothing personal. Sorry but I have to be honest and advise people to NOT take his class.",,
"Psychology 402 is a very difficult course. You have to attend every class and you must read the textbook in order to do very well in this class. He is a funny professor and makes you laugh once in awhile but honestly his teaching skills are not so good. In my opinion, when he is teaching he speaks as if you already know the material.",,
"I do not agree with the negative reviews, I was one of the top students in the class and he was a good professor. Very funny in class. Teaches to a high degree of expertise. Deliberately speaks clearly. Some other top students also liked him. Disgusted at the -ve reviews from students who felt ENTITLED to an A, but didn't get it handed to them.",,
I would NEVER take him again. Do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY!!!!,,
If you can take somebody else!!!,,
"I do not recommend him, he is not very helpful. He made an interesting class boring!",,
Do not take him!,,
"He is a nice person, but perhaps in the wrong job&#63; He knows his stuff, but it seems that people do not understand him. He also gave remarks about rating him here and on the faculty evaluation sheet CSUN gives us, I thought that was inappropriate to tell students, because we should be free to tell the truth as we see it.",,
"He is a nice guy, but never replies to e-mails and does not know how to teach as well as I expected. He also was very mean to a couple of students in class, maybe a little too sarcastic&#63;!",,
"Dr. Abara is a respectable professor. He doesnt need a book in order to teach a subject to his students, he clearly have extreme knowledge in his field of teaching. He maybe sarcastic but is funny. He is also approachable & helpful if it is w/in reason. Thought i would get a C but to my surprise studying my butt off got me an A in class & lab.",,
"Dr. Abara was an excellent teacher. HE knows his stuff, but this is an upper level course so expect do study. Was one of my toughest classes in college but my most rewarding, because I put in a lot of effort into the class. If your willing to learn he'll help you with the material.",,
"Worse professor I ever had in my life! He is a nice guy, but the worse professor EVER!!! Some people are smart, but simply can't teach!",,
"He is a very challenging teacher, but not as bad as everyone is making him out to be. He is very smart and is not like all the other teachers at csun who lecture out of the book and dont know what they are talking about. If you want an easy A dont take him, if you want to earn your grade take him. It is a challenging class but you'll learn a lot.",,
"Dr. Abara is excellent if you are prepared to interact on an intelligent and mature level. Seriously. I was intimidated at the start Psy.402 but his quality of teaching and mastery of material made me respect & admire him. He is a very special and gifted educator, attentive caring and approachable. LOVE HIM.",,
"Not nice. First day of school he acted like a 2 year old who needed a bottle. He is unprofessional, judgmental and course. I would rather eat my arm than finish the course with him. The material is difficult, so having a good guide is essential.",,
"He is very hard but you can do well because his tests are curving.I didn't like the presentations because only his favorite students got the chance to do it. Others just got free points and all of their effrots were for nothing. On the other hand, he understands your pressure with your late papers and is flexible if you have a reasonable excuse.",,
"I had him during summer and I learned alot, he teaches really good and would help if you ask him. he is mody but everyone is like that. I do recomend him, make sure to study alot. he would tell you what exactly you need to know for his midterms, doesnt sound good&#63;",,
"1. he does not teach psy 345 as the comment below stated! 2. WORST PROFESSOR THAT I HAVE EVER HAD. HE MAY KNOW THE MATERIAL, BUT MAYBE HE SHOULD LEARN HOW TO TEACH BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO BE A PROFESSOR OF A COLLEGE COURSE. THERE IS NOTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS BAD PROFESSOR, AND YOU WILL GET A BAD GRADE. UNLESS YOU TEACH YOURSELF!",,
"Currently in my 2nd class with Dr. Abara, who is one of the most fair and caring, and accessible professors I have ever met. He is professional and his class is difficult but he breaks it up with a great sense of humor. His disposition is extremely pleasant- whoever found him rude probably didn't have their ringer on silent... or failed.",,
"I must agree with the majority of these ratings. He loves to talk about drinking margaritas and his teaching style is not effective, or at least I don't consider reading from a power point very useful. He did make rude comments to more than one student, which I found less than amusing. I got a B but i do not recommend at all.",,
WORST teacher I have ever had. Unwilling to help. MOODY. Favors the guys in class. He thinks his teaching style is perfect regardless that half the class is failing. Says &quot;I don't know&quot; to questions asked in class at least 3 times a day. DO NOT TAKE HIM!!!,,
"one of the best professors in csun. if you took him and find yourself complaining, if you took him and are blaming him, then you dont know how to apply meta cognition while readin the textbook. immature kids.",,
"I don't know why everyone's saying he's hard. I never took notes, hardly ever went to class and never studied; however, I did read the text book. Cause of the super curve he uses a D will turn into a high A on his curve. Nice guy, kind of funny, but not very responsable towards his students. Fairly clear though, easy class, good teacher.",,
"Amazing that the last person said that Dr. Abara is rated to harshly.Yet they did'nt seem to leave high marks either-hmm&#63;Dr Abara plays favorites, is funny at times, until he insults you in a mocking way.Making him unprofessional!He curves grades as to not draw attent to himself for failing every student.Passing with an A is do-able after curving.",,
People complain all the time that this Professor is so hard. I think the most pivotal thing is to study on your own as well as in groups and make sure to read the book thoroughly. I got an A for both this class and lab. It's not that difficult,,
"stay away from this professor, he is very rude,He has no respect for his students, he doesn't know how to teach. I have no idea how get hired at CSUN. around five people in my class decided to file a complaint against him. if anyone else wants to file a Complain against him, they can go to the office and file the form.",,
"First off as is said WAY to hard midterms, by any standard. Spends half of class droning about drinking Worst thing is that your grade seems to be dependent on how he is feeling at the time. I put an hours worth of effort on studying for the midterms and for Ds Do yourself a favor and take someone else.HE IS RUDE Lecturer! 31 out 50 mean on exam",,
"DO NOT TAKE! this man has no idea on how to help students learn and enjoy learning. i put in hours of studying to get a D. I hope to pass the class! He never helps, wastes timein class, makes you feel stupid and brain dead. He has stupid jokes and thinks hes funny and people like him. My last semester at the school was sreadful thanks to him.",,
hard class!,,
cant teach. mean of the test was 25/30.A rude man from SF. DO NOT TAKE!,,
This is very hard class. But if you go to his office he will help you out. Hen seem rude at time. But he is nice when you talk to him one on one. I am gotten an D&#63;F. I hope I pass but he did help me lot. he is very funny!!!!!!!!!,,
Dr. Abara is an immature and rude professor. &quot;Etiquette of Teaching-101&quot; is what he needs to study! He needs to go back to research and leave teaching to those more qualified. He embarrassed me in class for speaking my honest opinion about why a test mean was 30/50. He'll do it to you! Stay away!,,
"nice sweet guy, 3 hard mid-term. But this is the best teacher for this class if you plan to move on to 402. study and you should pass the class. go to his office hours. he likes to help. he is very funny",,
This guy is crazy. he will make you want to call the blue project. Stay away from this guy. he is very hard. midterm are very hard. I am going crazy. going to call the blue project,,
abara loves to say look in the book and look in the syllabus. We ask questions because we need help not for some over pay teacher to tell us to look in the book and syllabus. yes he is a teacher not a professor. but cant teach at all. The mean was 30 out 50 in our midterm. YES HARD midterms,,
"nice professor to some students, knows his materials...yet tests are hard even when effort is put in to studying... and fun...also, he does not like to explain things when question is asked, however likes to talk about random things...not recommended. THIS CLASS is psy 402 not psych 802 at Harvard University. very hard! Very rude.",,
"Seriously, this man is hard and wants you to be filled with stress for this class. Don't take him!!!!! Chose another 400 level prof, Trust me!!!! The tests are extremely hard and he loves doing that to the students. Curve or not, it's not worth the stress!!!!!",,
"I have had a great experience at my school, and it all stoped when I met this professor. His moods are all over the place, he is the most unorganized teacher I have ever had.He gets upset if we ask questions and snaps at us. Seriously stay away!!!!",,
Very confusing! He acts as if you already know the material. Uses powerpoint and flips through them very fast that you can't even write anything down or pay attention to what he is saying. Please avoid taking anything with him. DANGER!,,
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT CLASS - WARNED NOT TO TAKE!,,
HORRIBLE PROFESSOR!!! NOT APPROACHABLE AT ALL!!! HE IS VERY INPATIENT AND GETS ANNOYED WITH STUDENTS WHEN THEY ASK QUESTIONS!!! THIS SUBJECT IS ANYTHING BUT EASY!!...DO NOT TAKE HIM!!,,
He is a nice guy but very hard test! alway happy,,
This professor needs to be fired. But he is a nice guy. But bad professor. Cant teach at all. He loves to talk about happy hour. everyday! He gets upset when we ask questions. He talks to fast. He is mad all the time and takes out on the class. I drop one test out of 3 very very very hard test.,,
"This is not an easy A class. If you are taking this class you have to study! Make sure to take good notes. If he see's that you are trying he will take it into consideration when grading. However, let him know that you are trying, he will work with you. He is not bad person as others make him sound.",,
HE IS A FUNNY PROFESSOR.HE HAS 3 TESTS HE DROPS THE LOWEST TEST SCORE YOU HAVE TO DO GOOD ON THE FIRST TWO THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THE FINAL.HE CURVES HIS TESTS THERE'S NO HW JUST HAVE TO READ.HIS T.A. HAS A STUDY SESSION THE FRIDAY BEFORE THE TEST AND HE GOES OVER EVERYTHING AND HE ANSWERS ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS.,,
"any professor that has to add 20 points to everyones score in order for them to pass his exams is either 1) not presenting his material in an intelligible way so that students understand him or 2) his tests are not reflective of what he &quot;has&quot; taught. Either way, this does not reflect favorably on his abilities as a professor.",,
"This is the most disorganized professor I have ever had....he grades your tests IN CLASS a week after taking the test! He should grade on his on time, not in class, we missed an entire lecture 3 times because of this!! He rambles, goes off on tangents and lets students side track him for toooo long...",,
"He's funny. Take good notes because most of the exam qustions are straight out of lecture. Do NOT text in his class, it's rude and seriously pisses him off.",,
i give him a low rating i lost interest in the class and stoped going,,
I hate him. He can't explain anything clearly. He can't even speak clearly. His exams are horribly difficult!! Questions make him really angry. And he goes through powerpoints for his lectures but does it too fast. Also each page has like 10 terms and he does not post all the powerpoint online. You have to study until your eyes bleed to pass!!!Bewa,,
"This professor is cool, i rarely did any work and received a &quot;B&quot;, just make sure you do well on your presentation and you'll be cool.",,
"Professor Abara is a really nice person who tries to help all of his students. He might look intimidating but once you approach him you'll see how wonderful he is. He curves most of his exams, definetly recommend study sessions before each exam and read the book to understand subject better. He's the BEST!!!!",,
"He is by far the best professor at CSUN! He is completely passionate at what he teaches. I took him for psy402, and got an A. People that complain about his class are simply lazy?.Hello!It?s an upper division class! You will learn a ton Read,take lots of notes, and go to all the study sessions he has before an exam. He offers tremendous help .",,
funny prof. difficult class but he works you through the steps.,,
he was absolutely hilarious. he's also very willing to help students. study what he tells you to study and you'll do well in the class,,
"omg i find him so amusing. he has a very odd and whimsical manner thats really hard to describe. as far as his class, just write down everything he says, pay attention to what he specifically points out as important, and memorize the slides. he obviously loves his subject. and notice how often he says &quot;it's aMAZing&quot;.",,
he knows the subject inside and out and emphasizes the most important items so you know what to study. also has this dry sense of humor that slips out every now and then that is hilarious. awesome class no doubt about it.,,
"He is an AMAZING teacher! I am taking his summer course and so far, I love the class! I am looking forward to the class progressing. He is a very helpful teacher and funny too!",,
"He's not your average teacher, takes a while to get used to his style. He isn't easy either, he cares a lot about your achievement if you put in the work. He scales the scores, so it's not so bad. Failed the first test, but ended up with an A in the class! :)",,
"Excellent professor. Class is fun and he really cares about his students! Very Kind, extremely smart,knows the subject inside out with no powerpoints or notes. He encourages students to do their best, by helping them achieve, He leaves a great impression. I loved the class, i'd take again with him if I had to. I love Abara the best.learned lots..",,
"Never thought I would ever say it, but I actually looked forward to going to his 5pm class - I loved him! He teaches in a simple enough manner and is very engaging. Tests are straight from the studyguide (buy the supplement)I learned so much from his class. Take him; you won't regret it.he is supersmart and talented. learn from him and take his cla",,

the comment below is a not true. You either work very hard to get a C or fail the class at the beginning. Your Choice.,,
Psy 350 is a very challenging course but if you take it with Professor Abara this class will be easy. He makes things easier to understand but definetly recommend to read the chapters to have a better understanding and you will score high on his exams. The final is optional. Great professor.,,
This professor needs to be fired,,
"If you are an A student, you will meet your greatest challenge in his class. Although he seems very generous on the exams, but that's only part of the story. 6 quizes & 5 questions on each, 30% weigh on final grade. Do a little math here: 6x5/30%=1% for each quiz question. 95%&gt;=A 90%&gt;=A-. Missing 2 quizes = bye to an A. And those Questions are HELL",,
Hard to understand. Can't pronounce certain words. Very confusing when explaining things and rambles on about things that don't make sense.,,
I wouldn't recomend this professor because he doesn't teach very well and you can't understand him with his accent. His tests have nothing to do with what he said in class,,
"One of the rudest professors I have ever met. Does not respect his students, so there is no question to why he has such bad ratings. Though he is smart, he is not cut out for teaching. Avoid taking him as much as possible, it is NOT worth it.",,
"Nice man, but bad teacher. Unorganized. When he speaks, his words are very unclear and don't make sense in his context. His tests have tons of errors throughout and practically need interpreting before answering them. Most students do poorly in figuring out test questions, so he has to do a lot of grade adjusting (he is VERY generous with curving!)",,
"This class is difficult, becasue the subject matter is very specific as are the test, it is easiest to understand Dr. Abara when you speak to him one on one, he is a great professor and very knowledgeable in this subject matter.",,
"I took him for Parenting and found him to be pretty cool. He's funny, very helpful and he assigned the EASIEST group project of my college life, which counted for a lot of our grade. If you do well on the first two exams you don't have to take the final. Maybe he's harder in core classes. I'll be taking him for an upper div. We'll see how it goes.",,
"I am in his class now, I have a test tomorrow and I don't know what the heck is going to be on the test. He constantly goes of into tangents. He gives you a useless handouts. Basically he is very very very unclear of what he wants from you. I wich I could drop",,
"Took his class many times. I, too, do not understand the bad ratings. Bottom line: He is very entertaining, funny, his tests are not easy but just study the text and NOT powerpoint or handouts and you will do well. Dont kid yourself, he curves very generously.",,
"I don't know why this professor get's such bad ratings. His tests are difficult, but if you do well on the first two, you don't have to take the final. Not an easy class, but he's extremely helpful! I like him!",,
The only positive thing I can say about him is that he's funny. His 250 class feels like an upper graduate studies class. He lectures everyday on the board until the test. The test doesn't even correspond to his lectures!!! I studied so hard for the first test and got a low C. He curved like 21 points because he realized some questions were not rea,,
"He is one of the most intelligent professors I've had at CSUN. Great professor!! 
  Tests are straight from powerpoint, must read the text. He only takes three test and drops the lowest score. Super smart guy, knows so much about psych info. Really loved this class!",,
"Ok professor. He loses his train of thought often. Can't keep up with his own syllabus. Gets side-tracked durning lecutre, then rushes as the end. Tries grade fair on the tests, he curves. Material is pretty difficult and his study guides suck. If you read the text thoroughly, you'll do fine.",,
"he's a nice guy, but is horrible at teaching. i understand he's really smart but he isn't meant to teach. his lectures are unclear and hardly ever really similar to his exams. doesn't prepare the class well for the exams either. you basically have to teach yourself.",,
professor abara is a very nice professor. He is very hard and his class is very challenging. I was going through alot of family problems and he could have failed me but he didnt and he was very supportive! he's not that confusing just read your notes and Pay attention in class!!!,,
Dont bother listening to his lecture because he will just confuse you!! All of his lectures come straight out of the book and are just explained in a way to confuse the HELL out of you and make him sound really smart. He spends his time searching for BIG words (that aren't ever REAL words) to make him sound like a genius.Very unclear and unorganize,,
"I agree with most of the people that he say he is not very clear or organized. However, he is very generous when he grades his tests. To get an A, you need to take good notes and follow up the subjects he talks about in class with text reading. He is very interesting and knows this subject. If you do well in the firsts the final is optional.",,
"very unorganized, but easy class...3 exams but drops the lowest score (and he always added extra points to your score)...one group project/presentation...no papers...study the chapters in your textbook and you'll do fine",,
Professor does not prepare you for his test. His teaching methodologies are terrible. I would definitely not take him again.,,
"nice professor, knows his materials...yet tests are hard even when effort is put in to studying...course project is do-able and fun...also, he does not like to explain things when question is asked, however likes to talk about random things...not recommended...",,
"Was an okay class, sometimes boring but then sometimes interesting. Gives 3 papers to write. You have to takes good notes and write down everything he says because he wants to see it on the papers! Have to go on a field trip to a monestary.",,
He waisted a lot of time in class. His lecture is not helpful for the exam.,,
"Sooooooo frustrating and unorganized! Can't keep up with own syllabus because he's always getting off track on someone's question or a stray thought that crosses his mind. Will speed lecture because he needs to get caught up, can't spell and mispronunciates sooooo many words! Laughable! Class is not hard, just frustrating! Seems like a nice guy",,
"God help you if you are taking this class....His notes suck, his tests are extremely hard and his &quot;study guides&quot; are nothing of the sort....and his class is extremely boring.",,
All you have to do to get A is attending the class and reading assigned text book!! Then grade A comes to you automatically. I'm not joking.,,
"Jose tries very hard to be clear and fair. Unfortunately, he isn't often clear on assignments or what is required to know for tests. He IS helpful if he thinks you're serious and really trying though. For this subject, another prof might be better.",,
TAKE ABARA!!! Hes the best...GREAT Personality,,
professor abara is a very good man... i had alot of trouble in this class and he was really there to help me out. at the end he passed me with a C. this class was not easy but he is a wonderful teacher. i would retake this class all over again. he makes alot of funny jokes.,,
"Horrible horrible horrible OMG You cant follow any of his lectures he gives you attitude if you ask a question , he thinks youu are only attending his class and dont have tons of other work to do . Worst class ever. I'M CHANGING MY MAJOR",,
"abara is a god-sent professor. he's totally funny, and extremely devoted to his teaching. he always offers expainations and holds study sessions before exams. his tests are a little hard but he's a lenient grader. go for him all the way!",,
"nice guy. tests are a bit hard, even if you study. but he offers review sessions beforehand, which i didn't take so i don't know if they help or not. sometimes a bit hard to follow and lectures get a bit wordy and detailed. not bad overall though.",,
"STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!!!! ABARA IS DISORGANIZED, AND GIVES UNFAIR TESTS. HE IS THE MOST UNHELPFUL PROFESSOR. TAKE ANYONE ELSE",,
"Exams are difficult but they are heavily weighted. You have to attend class and pay attention in order to pass this class; of course, the eye candy sure helps!",,
No Comments,,
Very good teacher,,
don't tak ethis teacher for an easy A. his exams are difficult but his curves will bump up your grade enormously. Cool personality and helpful before exams.,,
"Excellent professor...he truly cares for his students and their well being...very helpful, and undrestanding...I recomend him to any student who is intrested in learning with fun.",,
"um..well, he's a nice guy, he DOES care for his students. He grades on a curve..which is GREAT! You just have to read! do not slack off or there can be consequences",,
"Read the chapters before hand, pay attention and take notes and you'll do fine. You can't slack off in this class and it pays to seriously be ahead of schedule. It may start off slow, but be prepared to study a lot and you should be fine. You WILL learn something in this class, so what comes out is a reflection of what you put in. Good luck!",,
"Not good professor. Never gives enough time to copy notes, not concerned over students, always wanting to leave class. would lecture on tardiness and himself was tardy on many occasions, i still failed all midterms and received C, all depends if you try to make an effort to get to talk to him before he rushes out of class",,
"He was good and passionate. Before the mid-term exam, he would let you know which part of the text you have to read. Follow his class with hardworking and you will be OK. Hardworking is necessary.",,
VEry unclear the mean for the exams was about a 50% and no one knew what he was teaching. Unprepared and rushed lectures. I failed all midterms and somehow recieved a b in the class&#63;!&#63;! Take at your own risk!,,
"Not a very good class at all. not clear on notes, never gives enough time to copy notes, never makes himself available to students, always first one to leave class and hates people to stop him for questions. is often late, but scolds others for tardiness. to pass midterms need to read text between lines. to pass class READ, READ, READ",,
"Great teacher that cares about his students, test are on a curve and he gave extra credit. Very Nice!!",,
"HE FREAKING ROCKS! As said before, he really cares about his student. You actually have to study and pay attention, but as long as you do, you will be in good shape",,
He is one of the very few professor that still care for his students. He is awesome.,,
i dont know what everyone is talking about! Abara is a cool professor. He takes his weekends off to make study sessions for students. (& goes over every question that would be covered on the test),,
"Abarra is very knowledgable and caring. The tests are challenging, but you will learn a lot. Since his emphasis is in physiology, you will be VERY prepared for 250.",,
tHis teAcher wAs ill.......... y0u d0nt need t0 be in clAss everydAy and thAT alwAys a plus f0r me he knows his**** lectures are long but its psychology people,,
awesome teacher.very caring,,
Abara is a very good professor because he makes sure that lecture material is fully covered and explains class material with clear statements and good examples. His class is very easy to pass although u really need to study for them. This class is an easy A.,,

Great Teacher! Very Funny! Goes thru everything that will be on tests. Easy A!!!,,
"Good class, too bad I had to drop out of school last semester due to family death",,
"He is a very good professor because he demonstrates competency and efficacy when teaching his classes., and he makes class interesting by displaying enthusiasm and makes sure that everything he covers is clear.",,
easy to pass although you don't learn anything,,
we bet money on how many times he says &quot;you shee&quot; or &quot;very interestingly&quot; about 20 times + a day lol,,

I LOVED THIS TEACHER.....I DUNNO WHY HE GOT SUCH BAD RATINGS!!,,
2 days of class dowN seems pretty easy...gives 3 exams aNd couNts 2 best oNes,,
Almost made me rethink my major. He is THAT BAD.,,
"i thought he was a good teacher. the tests were awesome, he gave us all the pages to study for as a study guide. easy to get an A.",,
he is not a good teacher very rude and he goes through the power point slides to fast. he is very moody and has created his own grading scale so you never know what grade your gonna get,,
"I would have enjoyed the class if he didn't teach it. Didn't like his teaching skills- was only into what he wanted to tell us regarding his research, not what we needed to learn about abnormal psych. in general. I don't recommend taking him.",,
"class is mostly common knowledge about parenting but for some reason he tries to complicate it, speeds thru powerpoint and doesnt give anyone a chance to take notes...he is unorganized doesnt even remember when he said a test will be... also extremely moody, stupid jokes when he's in a good mood, rude comments when he's in a bad mood. DONT TAKE HIM",,
"I don't recommend this teacher. I didn't learn anything. He is a nice guy, however his emotions are all over the place. He isn't very organized and his exams are way to hard.",,
"his class isnt as hard as i thought a psych class would be. if u study what he tells u, ur set. he confuses himself sometimes and the students tend to correct HIM a lot",,
"I can't believe they'd hire such a horrible, clueless teacher. Very arrogant and seems to hate the students. He's very fake.",,
"He has to be the W-O-R-S-T teacher at CSUN. He doesnÛªt keep to his syllabus, tries to teach a million things with as much detail as possible and then tells you for the review that you have to know all of it. His test is then about some small detail. Add to the fact that no one can understand him.",,

ADVISE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR DON'T TAKE HIM,,
"He's nice and all, but he really needs to change his method of teaching and become more concise and clear during his lectures. Good luck on his exams, he pulls about 80% of them out of the air.",,
This professor is one of the most unclear people you could ever have. He changes his mind on what the answer is from the test so if you taking this class make sure you check with him and fight for your grade because if you think you are right you probably are.,,
"Unclear of what he wants from you. Everyone failed the first test, but let's you drop lowest test. Assigned group project with a 10 page paper.",,
easy grader,,
"Good teacher. If u do the study guides that he gives the tests are cake otherwise u will be disappointed. Need to do review assignments, which arenÛªt bad but I still donÛªt know how he came up with the grade 4 them. Overall good teacher",,
"very nice guy. slightly moody, but answers questions as much as he can. does expect you to do reading--u need to in order to pass. not a bad grading scale either... i got a 67% on a midterm and got a B-. again, not a good class to take if you're lazy.",,
"This professor is amazingly intelligent and he makes really funny jokes in class as well. If you have the ability to study, you can do well in this class. You have to keep up with the class to do well, but that is to be expected. There are 3 tests and 3 hw assignments.",,
IF YOU WANT TO TEACH YOURSELF THEN THIS WILL BE A GREAT CLASS. HE IS UNCLEAR ABOUT EVERYTHING AND GOES OFF ON MAJOR TANGENTS DURING LECTURES. AND THOSE SOCKS AND SANDALS ARE REALLY SEXY TOO!! AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS IF YOU ARE A PSYCH MAJOR AND YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO LEARN SOMETHING.,,
No Comments,,
A self teach course. Very moody . Unclear with ALL of his materials. He is very confusing. Spend too much time on the class doing presentations tha are not related to the course. I would not reccommend him. He is a terriable professor how knows his stuff but does not know how to teach.,,
"if all you want to do is show up & get an A, wrong class, but this class is easy if you make an attempt.his curve is crazy-a 50% is a C or something.3 tests, 3reviews, and he takes the highest 2 of each.talk to him once like a friend-A. hes quitting cuz of this site, tho. really too bad.",,
No Comments,,
The class overall might be challanging to those who are used to teachers who hand feed you all the notes and lectures! He is very passionate about his work knows what he is talking about and can really broaden you experience in college. Take him it will be an accomplishment.,,
He is a great professor and knows how to teach in a manner that won't allow you to fall asleep.,,
"everyone should really lighten up! he might talk funny, but just pay attention & take good notes. he even gives page numbers for questions on exams. do well on the 2/3 review assignments and tests. easy pass.",,
A little too flamboyant and discusses personal life and how many margaritas it takes to get him hammered. If you can self teach yourself and stay awake during his lecture then it is liveable,,
If you are taking this as a G.E. there are far better teachers. Way too confusing/complex. Take another teacher.,,
Very confusing! He acts as if you already know the material. Uses powerpoint and flips through them very fast that you can't even write anything down or pay attention to what he is saying. Please avoid taking anything with him. DANGER!,,
"If u read text book(he gives u SPECIFIC page# for exam)and remember stuff from lecture(he tells u which gonna be on exam), u can get&quot;A&quot; on exam.U also need to do group presen & 2reading report.I can't understand why so many students complained...why&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;I think he is a nice and unique.",,
"teacher is confusing as hell, dont take this if you cherish your sanity.",,
His teaching is all over the place. His tests are exttremel hard. Don't take him!!!!,,
HE SUCKS! DONT DO IT!,,
HORRIBLE. DO NOT TAKE. DO NOT TAKE!!!,,
"Yeah he sucks as a teacher, chnages his mind on**** and on the test expects you to know everything.",,
"Unbelievably unfriendly, not helpful, inconsiderate, arrogant.",,
"Professor Abara is one of my favorite teachers this semester. He knows his stuff, and he's always willing to clarify. He's also VERY funny, and he rarely gets mad. Tests aren't a breeze, but what do you expect from psychology&#63; His class is awesome!!",,
"I worked very hard in this class and barely pulled a B. He knows his stuff but does not know anything about teaching. You take 2-3 pages of notes/day which only covers 30% of test. The other 70%, good luck.",,
"Very unclear. Goes off on tangents. Nice guy, but doesn't explain things very well. Relates the topics to things that he finds of interest. Would not recommend.",,
"He's a nice guy, but geeeeez don't ask him to clarify anything you will just get more confused.",,
"Must go to class. Its very hard to pay attention tho. The tests are HARD. He covers ALOT. i thot the class was goin to be more interesting; i was kinda disappointed. He tries to make jokes which is cool, but the class is dull",,
"Although does have many mood swings, and is 90% of the time atleast 5 min late. He does seem to generally try to get people to understand. His test are HARD! but he practially tells you what the questions on the test are. Pay Att. and you will be ok.",,
confusing professor to understand.,,

"Most people who gave this guy a good rating did so becos he came to class and talked about this website. In a way he does suck. As much as u can, avoid Abara. Just not confident and so is he class. His tests are as weird as his class. Just stay away.",,
"If you have a hard time in this class, ITS YOUR FAULT! This guy is very easy to understand plus if you have any questions he is more than happy to answer them. Go to his office hours, he'll gi ve you some class paricipation points.",,
"First, this is a college class so for all of you that think this class is hard then hey &quot;reality check.&quot; When are you going to have a professor that gives you exactly what he is going to ask ahead of time&#63; Stop complaining & start studying!",,
Buy him a doggone Diet Coke.,,

"Here's the thing u actually have to go to class, and do the reading assignments he counts 2/3 but do them they help for the midterms/final(all his tests are hard but he only counts two of them so if you do well the final isnt necesary).He's not that bad.",,
This professor is really nice. He explains subjects very clearly and thoroughly. I like how he tells us which pages from the book to study for each midterm. He also tells students that these pages contain the answers to the questions on the midterms.,,
"This guy is ridiculous, he lacks confidence and knowledge, and covers it up by changing the subject. I would not suggest this professor, nor do I think he should be teaching at all.",,
"I hated this class. He is not clear, and I dont understand what he says. I learned everything form the book. I studied my whole weekend for his final and I got a B-. Do not take him, he will stress the f!@#$%!! out of you.",,
"class is boring, gives page number for items that will be on exam, but you have to study to do well in this class, and do reading assignments",,

He grades hard!!!,,
"A challenging teacher. Very difficult exams. He is very nice in person..sometimes his jokes are off topic ;0 but all in good fun. Lecture notes sometimes typed up too. If you have him, just be sure to do the reading assignments and study HARD...",,
"She makes you work for your grade. Pay attention to the lectures and take good notes! Every week you write essays based on the readings. Each is worth 10 points, make sure you do them. Do not slack off! Take home midterm, so if you don't do well then it is your fault. Final is super easy, she basically gives you the answers.",,
Professor Sandoval may come off as rude but that's just how she is! She makes you work for your grade.. weekly essays that are based off some readings you read and a final that she basically gives you the answers too!,,
She is an amazing teacher. The only reason you will not pass the class is because you don't do the homework. Really fun teacher and I would recommend her but be prepared to work. She does not mess around with laziness. 10 2-3 essays on the weekly readings where some are interesting. Take home midterm. And final which she pretty gives the answers to,,
"This 200 class has way more work than my other 400 classes. I expected a lot of reading for a history class, but this class is hard work. On an easy week expect about 4 different reading materials/videos each week, but there can be as much as 10 reading materials. I seriously would not recommend this class or the teacher.",,
"This class is an easy A, IF you do the work! Expect 10 essays (2 page), a 5 page take home midterm, 5-7 minute presentation, and 8-9 page in-class hand written final. It sounds dreadful, but it was probably my easiest class. If you fail, it's because you're lazy. She literally hands you the answers to the midterm and final! Great teacher!",,
"This course was a tl;dr of a Black Lives Matter protest. Mostly a summation of how every minority was oppressed by the whites. It was both hilarious and painfully dull to write about. By week 2, you'll have written White privilege at least 45 times. You pretty much get full points for writing BS like that and slapping quotes on them. Have fun.",,
Sandoval should understand that she is teaching a General Education ONLINE course. Her course outline isn't ridiculous but incredibly tedious and pointless. The level of commitment she requires actually insinuates that students have spent their waking hours thinking about the impact of irrelevant Latin civilizations.,,
"She is one of the rudest professors I have ever had. Misunderstand a prompt and all of a sudden she's talking down to you accusing you of not reading a prompt. I'm sorry but I was truly excited for the class, but she ruined it for me. Also, giving projects where we have to run around LA to visit places?No, thanks! College students don't have time !",,
"I've only had her for her OL course. Sandoval is not hard, she's just extremely rigid. Her guidelines and criteria dictates that you should follow her style of writing to a tee. If not, prepare to pay for it. It doesn't matter how well you write, only by how well you mimic her writing style. Take her if you like to write like sheep.",,
worst teacher ive ever had,,
"AVOID THIS CLASS. SHE IS ONE OF THE WORST PROFESSOR WHEN IT COMES TO ONLINE CLASS. SERIOUSLY, IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER OPTION, DON'T TAKE HER. IT'S NOT WORTH IT.",,
"I'm only on the 3rd week of the online summer class, but I had to share: DO NOT TAKE HER!!! Assigns WAY too many assignments (all writing) in weekly periods. 2 400word discussion posts tuesthurs, a 3page essay due friday, & quiz on sunday same schedule each week. Also assigns way too much reading for a simple GE subject. Save yourselves.",,
"Absolutely the worst professor that I've ever had! She is way too strict and very rude towards students. She requires too much for an intro class. If you decide to take her, know that she gives absolutely no partial credit, one 10 point extra credit, LOTS of reading and writing every week. Just do yourself a favor and don't take her.",,
This is a very interesting and enlightening course but she can be very unappealing and rude at times. Though she means well her way of addressing students is very negative. Weekly essays are essential to pass but she is a tough grader and expects a lot for a 100 class. If this is not your major stay clear and look for someone else.,,
"Yes, this professor is helpful and does give you much help towards your final and midterm. However, there are weekly essays assigned every week with articles that need to be reads upwards to 20 pages. Which i believe is a lot of work. Definitely tough grader. Large amounts of reading, notes, lectures, videos, and to be honest a lot of rudeness.",,
I see so many bad comments of Professor Sandoval but I thought she was great! She makes you work for your grade & is dedicated to her beliefs & what she teaches. This class can change your perspective & way of thinking. She does give out weekly journals on the readings but they're only 1 and a half-2 pages. Jst do the readings & you'll pass!,,
"I took her class last summer and she makes the class very easy if you actually try. The tests are exactly what she asks for in the study guide. She gave many extra credit opportunities. My final grade was 3 points away from a perfect score thanks to all of the extra credit. she requires weekly posts, no big deal. Would definitely take her again!",,
Interesting class although more work than expected. Very clear from the very beginning of class about what's expected so double check syllabus before asking a question on the assignments. Always take notes very important for her midtem and final!!! Challenging class and you can definitely pass but no slacking off.,,
"Dr. Sandoval is one of the best professors in the Chicanao Studies department. Not only it is a 100 class. She makes you work for a high grade in her class and assignments. Her lectures are very interesting, especially about her work in Low Rider culture and the Chicanao culture as well. Talk to her in her office hours, your grade will thank you!",,
"Her attitude most class sessions was very unappealing and made me hate being in the class although I found her lectures interesting. I would recommend looking at other professors, although she does know her stuff, taking her class wasn't the greatest experience.",,
"Very hard class. Essays due every week, 6 page mid-term, presentation, and an in class essay. Also she is very picky about grading marks you off for almost anything. She is also not very approachable and treats you like a little kid. You really have to work for a good grade in this class and that may not even be enough.",,
"I loved her! Her passionate towards teaching the subject empowers me to work hard. She is very helpful, friendly and very funny. She makes lecture interesting and I would definitely recommend anyone to take her.",,
"Denise is a very dedicated professor. Her class is one of the most demanding classes I've had at CSUN but coming from a UC, this work level and quality of work is EXPECTED. Consider her 'hard' assignments and 'sassyness' as her way of pushing students to become better students. This class was not impossible nor hard. She is also a fair grader.",,
"I went into this class ignorant about my culture and I'm now filled with so much knowledge. I am proud to call myself a chicana. However, professor Sandoval is tough. She's sassy, she's mean, she doesn't answer your questions. Rather, she responds with another question 'you should already know.' Journals every week, and you can't BS.",,
"TERRIBLE CLASS. Do not take this class even if graduation depends on it. I swear to you that you will hate life when taking this class. She isn't teaching Chicano studies, she is teaching feminism in class. Tons of work to do and very annoying In class with her style of teaching. Would never recommend taking this class.",,
"Very hard class, requires lots of work. Though its an online class she makes you go to 2 places and write a 10pg paper, its ridiculous.",,
this class requires a lot of reading and writing for a 100 level class. More work than my upper division classes (400)in my major.,,
Took this class as filler to maintain full time status and this class contained more work than my previous 10 upper division classes in my major.I worked for A and u will have to work for it. This is not a laid back class but i learned a lot about my own cultural history.,,
"Just found out what my final is. 7 handwritten pages with one flashcard of notes allowed. Terrible class, made me hate school.",,
By far the MOST WORK I've ever had to do for one class. 15k+ words written for the semester. A discussion every week plus essays and semester length research project. She provides NO feedback for written work either. DO NOT CHOOSE THIS TEACHER,,
HARDEST GRADER THERE IS! Gives SO much homework! One essay per week. Quizzes that no one could pass since she grades so tough! Your essay will never be good enough for her even if you follow all the directions. I HATE THIS CLASS SO MUCH! It is the only class I'm stressing in. Save yourselves from a headache and just don't take this class. Unless you love a challenging grader and love extra work. Good luck! You'll need it!,,
This prof. made my semester hell. She contradicts much of what she says & is very judgmental when it comes to essays (which there are ALOT of). This is expected from a college prof. except her grammatical and spelling errors are way too frequent so I wouldn't trust her judgement. I learned a lot but had to teach myself. Passed but I don't recommend,,
"In my opinion, she is a difficult professor. Too much reading, essays ever week and its just too much work. Dont recommend her. You need to try really hard to get a good grade, surprisingly i got a good grade.",,
"AVOID CLASS, If it is too late for you just know that there is a lot of work but the class is very insightful do all your work attend every class and you will pass with a breeze do not slack off, professor does seem unapproachable but there is a reason to her way of teaching and behaving towards students",,
"I learned a lot, however teacher is pretty unapproachable. I am not particularly keen on grading based on the teachers opinion, but that's how the class is. Overall, my other more important classes were definitely affected negatively as this class is ALOT of busy work. May God be with you if you have this professor.",,
"I now know so much about my Chicano history because of this class!Don't take this class if CH doesn't interest you. The analytical readings are kind of difficult and you can't bs the weekly 2pg essay.She is very intelligent, kind of intimidating but fair. Must attend class!Take alot of notes during lectures, they save you for the midterm and final!",,
"DO NOT TAKE. Besides the fact that she treats you as a child or at least a High School student, she is very strict and rude. Horrible semester because of this professor.",,
DO NOT TAKE!!!! I HATE THIS CLASS!! like the week class is suppose to end she added an extra quiz and an extra essay!!! WTF??? are you serious lady!!!!! get a life!!!! My first C of my college career thanks to her!,,
"WAAAAY too much work for a GE class. Please avoid this professor AT ALL costs. It took over my life and caused so much unecessary stress, I wish I chose a different history class! We have two historical sites to visits, 10 page final, 400-500 essay every week that we only get 5 days to work on, three ridiculous quizzes, 2 journals...HATED all of it",,
"I do not recommend for anyone to take this course unless they have a lot of time in their hands. The reason why I say this is because there is A LOT of work. I am talking about 3 essays, 2 journals, 1 10 page research paper and each week she makes you read A LOT in order to complete a 400-500 analysis on what you read. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE.",,
I would not recommend this professor. I really hope you listen to this advice. It is too much work she thinks this is our only class we have and the quizzes are really hard and I am an A student so I know what I am talking about. Please I am warning you now do not take her. you will regret it.,,
"She's clearly intelligent. She really expects her students to analyze critically and understand the material. We were required to do heavy readings and write a analytical 2page paper every week. Nearly 50% of the reading wasn't of my interest. She's not a professor for students to slack off, she makes you work but then again there are worser profs.",,
Please with all my heart i beg you not to take her. It is not a challenge its just so much work and so little time and she swears her class is our world. I don't think you should take her unless you are a CHS major..even then enter if you dare!,,
"She assigns a 400-500 typed essay on friday, due wednesday at noon...WTH? Def not enough time to finish! With all the other 300 and 400 level classes we students have, how do i finish in only 4 days! Not to mention partime job! Totally regret taking this class",,
"She is a hard teacher, he class requires more reading than the bible, journals are due every week, she is not understanding and not an easy grader. Do Not take this class unless you want to get a P.H.D. in Chicano studies",,
"Do not take her.... took this class for an online course...regret it, and now i do not want to take any online courses because of her. Theres alot of work, yes but its easy. Reason why i regret it is because when you ask a question she responds with a smart answer..making you feel dumb.. DO NOT TAKE HER",,
"Fantastic teacher!!! She really wants her students to succeed. I am happy I took this course with her. I got a B+ and that was my fault for procrastinating in the end. She is tough, but very fair. She always has her office door open and will help you with anything you don't understand or want to discuss. You wonÌ¢??t regret taking her course.",,

"Took the online course and for a 200 level class, there is A LOT of work. My major is unrelated to CHS and found that I had to spend a great deal of extra time for this course and it took time away from my major courses. The course isn't hard, but it certainly requires a lot of attention and dedication.",,
She really is not as bad as everyone says. Yes it's annoying you have to write an essay analyzing articles every week but you can prettt much bs them! I got an A...she's not that bad! And you learn a lot,,
Shes really a good prof to have & looking back I learned ALOT due to all the reading & writing we had each week so not an easy A!The person who said&quot;her class is only hard if you make it hard on yourself&quot;I agree with 100%!Shes really cool with you if you do all the work and that she sees your actually trying.Got an A but really busted my ass 4 it!,,
"I am currently in her online class and she is definitely is going to make you work hard. Plan to dedicate at least 3-4 hours a week on this class. The material is not hard, but you have to do the work. 4 quizes, 4 critical essays, and 10 pg historical project. I really like her, but man does she like to read!",,
"Demanding teacher, however if you do all the readings (I always struggled), go to class, and do well on the quizzes and the cultural assignment you will do well. I got an A and I'm not Latina. She did get upset with a few students, but I always did as she expected and I did well. She's a pretty cool/tough chick and she knows her material, pay attn",,
Best Professor ever!!! She's such a strong Chicana! Her class is hard but its worth it. AWESOME:D,,
DON'T TAKE HER!!! she only likes it her way and isn't here for the interest of the students! she doesn't help you with your questions on assignments. I always do my assignments but i regret taking her.,,
"Class is boring, can't ask her a question unless you want to feel stupid. I was the one of the 4 Asians in the class, therefore I had lots of questions but I ended up asking it during her hours. Final project, presentation about your family life. Power point; 4-5 slides, MUST cover everything in 10 minutes. Students & prof will rate you.",,
"First Off, do not take her!! She teaches her basic level classes like her upper division courses. she does not help and if you ask a question she makes you feel like you are a foolish child. This is one of the few professors that i will never forget and for all the wrong reasons. She lets her politics and emotions for the subject dictate the class.",,
"one word: unapproachable. The course requirements were clearly laid out the first day -no surprises. You must make the commitment to actually read ALL the material and prepare for in class quizzes otherwise, you WILL fail. Expect to read about 20+ pages a week (which is little compared to Upper Division Eng. courses). If you're a good writer and cr",,
"Professor uses Course Reader. Did weekly readings and had to turn in a one-two page summary of what we read. Grade is based on two midterms, a final, and a cultural presentation. Lectures were quite lengthy. Group discussions were based on the course reader.",,
absolutely the best professor for CHS or any class really. She is a great person as well as professor. For those who rated her harshly on the online class it's because she had never given an online class before! STILL AMAZING PROFESSOR! CLEAR AND INTELLIGENT DO TAKE HER CLASS!!!!!!!!!!!!,,
"Do not take this professor, there is something really wrong with her. I took her for an online class, I had to do 4 major essays, 4 really unclear exams, a 10 page research assignment that requires a visit to her assigned museums, discussion posts every week, 4-5 articles and 2-3 chapters of reading.",,
Honestly the worst teacher I have had at CSUN. She is ridiculous and she can't even use proper grammar. She is so unhelpful when asked about ANYTHING. I definitely feel like I would have learned more and been less resentful about the subject matter if I had read the book alone without her idiotic and unintelligent lectures. DO NOT TAKE!,,
HARD!,,
"I hate this teacher. Seriously, her expectations are unrealistic she gives way too many pages to read in one night. She can't answer simple questions. In my opinion she is a very angry person inside and takes it out on her students. She makes me want to cry everyday and quit school, never have I been so uninspired to quit school. She's terrible.",,
This teacher demands that you devote 3-5 hours a day only to her work. She has unreal expectations in what she expects you to read daily and provides no feedback as to why your grade is the way it is. DO NOT TAKE THIS WOMAN unless you have large amounts of free time and are willing to devote it completely to this class. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!,,
Really an amazing teacher. She might seem a little bit strict but her teaching methods are very good and her personality brings the class to life.,,
She is a very smart teacher and does not allow anyone to slack off. You use a reader instead of a book that costs about $40 outside of school in some store. She's a devout feminist and its very interesting to hear her lectures. But she's funny at times and always speaks with a smile on. She welcomes questions but it is at times intimidating.Ok prof,,
By the end of the semester she earned all my respect. She is dope!! She definitely knows her stuff and if you're smart you will pick up on that knowledge. Those who say she is hard must be really stupid and I know this because I had many of you idiots in my class. She is clear about her expectations and standards.,,
NICE TEACHER,,
"All of those who wrote thing about her some of it is true. She is hard, but personally I think that she is a good professor.Her course is hard but only if you make it hard for yourself. She is not your friend she is your professor. Attend class, read, and study!! If you have questions ASK HER!!!! she is willing to help, if you are willing to learn",,
she knows what shes talking about! so dont try and challenge her. GO TO CLASS! you get attendance points and although she may not stress it at first in the end you will be screwed! her mid term is take home and the final is alright (both essays). although she is very picky about essays they need to be PERFECT!,,
"Yeah...I took the online classes, and though i learned a great deal from this class... the tests are SPECIFICALLY designed to hurt your grade. Don't take unless you love a challenge. I am not gonna lie however, i learned ALOT from this class.",,
DO NOT TAKE!!! She is a very knowledgeable professor but her attitude is terrible. I?ve never had such a rude prof in my 4 years of college. One think for sure is that she enjoys be littling her students. The environment in her class feels very tense and her students are afarid to ask any Q. She needs an attitude adjustment thats for sure. She's a,,
"Her online class is terrible. She is not clear, the tests are specifically set up to hurt your grade, and she is not thorough in her explanations. For example, she makes typos and she doesn't post quizzes on the correct time she says she will. Not reliable, not learning, and unfun. DO NOT TAKE ONLINE. In person would've been much better",,
"Professor singles out students...NOT willing to help at all...most of her class is scared of her! Most students are scared to even ask questions. Got an A from doing all the work but am still traumatized by how she belittles her students. TERRIBLE experience in this class, would NOT recommend it at all",,
"This class is really easy Show up for class take, good notes during lectures & do the study guide. I NEVER read the book all I did was the study guide & I got an A on the tests. The research paper is really simple to do don't let the # of pages scare you because trust me you can fill up the 15 pages really fast.",,
You gota work for an A. No smooth sailing here. BUT that being said test are extremly easy becuase she gives us every question on the test on the reveiws a week prior! Long but easy 14page paper due. She is an expert in her feild and is very passionate. Good proffesro but be ready to read and write!,,
"I really liked her, but some people did not. I must admit, I was on her good side, so she liked me, but if you get on her bad side, forget it, she will tease you in class! Just show up on time, make sure you do the readings, and answer questions. A LOT of reading and a hard paper, but not too bad. Tests can be hard. I got an A, but I worked for it.",,
"This teacher does not play around. She is pationate about what she is teaching. I have to admit she is really hard, but you learn a lot in her class. She goes over all the reading!!! She gives four test and they consist of short answers and short paragraphs. I recomend you start on your reserch project day one to avoid the stressing out.",,
I have never been so disgusted to have a Professor who completely disregards the fact that she is dealing with adults. Regardless of the fact some students are there fresh from High School doesn?t mean she has free reign to belittle students intelligence. I hope she learns social skills to go along with her vast knowledge! Then maybe she may be a,,
"This professor is extremely hard. She is rude, inconsiderate, condescending, disrespectful and treats her students as if they are five years old. There are four finals in the class-one every few weeks. This teacher needs to go and teach high school.",,
"This class is not for lazy students. There is a lot of work and reading, but its really easy once you do it. She gives 4 quizes which are short answers/short paragraphs and that's really easy since she gives a study guide with the same exact questions on the test. Keep up with the readings and make sure you start the site project early!!",,
She's very intelligent and has a good grasp on the subject and makes class interesting. I definitely would have to say she's a great professor thus far. She's also very cute and has beautiful eyes. For you recent highschoolers: Make sure you remember this is college and treat this class as such... I don't think she tolerates kiddish behavior.AN,,
"Class is easy if you keep up with class readings. You'll be given the exam questions which are exactly the same in the test, short answers/paragraphs. Sometimes there are some bonus questions. The hard part is the site visiting project which requires a lot of time. If you wanna get an A, take this class.",,
"Prof. Sandoval is a good professor who is willing to help out students. The class may be a bit difficult for being lower division, but the work load is very manageable for students who are serious about college. She offers extra credit opportunitied as well, which helps a lot.",,
hello SHE IS SO HARD FOR CSUN. YES we are in college. NO TAKE,,
"Okay so she does flip her hair every 5 seconds but so what, who cares. I honestly thought she was a great professor & i learned so much from her. All these people below me probably didnt like her cause they got a bad grade in her class cause she isnt easy, but hello we are in college! Take her if your actually going to pay attention & want to learn",,
"It feels sad to see all of these negative comments, but a lot of them are very true. She makes me want to reach out to her because she is so hardened and somewhere deep in her is a heart, but we can't see it. I wish that she could feel human warmth and love. She will. Be tolerant and understand that she's in a process like all of us are. Be nice.",,
She clearly has insecurity issues and takes it out on other women in her class she thinks are her competition. Having a PHD for her is seriously only a professional HATER DEGREE. So much for her XICANA solidarity. I guess she needs a man!,,
"This professor is a great professor she tells you what she is looking for in the 6 papers you wil have to write. The is a small quiz at the begining of each class on the reading.

MY WHOLE LIFE IVE HATED HISTORY AND FOR THE 1ST TIME I LOVED A HIST CLASS..There are only 4 quizzes and they r exactly like the study guide..She really knows her stuff..she assigns a hist project..do it on time because its pretty long...GREAT CLASS!! she can be rude sometimes but she likes teaching!,,
"sandoval is a great prof. alot or work & alot of reading BUT i gurantee, u will learn!! i enjoyed her class, she always had interesting lectures and she is a very brilliant woman.she has a passion for teaching!",,
"Honestly, eventhough she can be a b*tch sometimes, the class is pretty easy. She gives study guides that are exactly like her quizes. The material is a little repetative and boring. U learn some interesting stuff. Just do the work, dont get on her bad side, and u will be fine. Oh, and she always says &quot;RIGHT&quot;.",,
"Great teacher that teaches with much passion for the subject. She will make you learn, think, and will motivate to do your best. There is alot of readings and papers, but no final or midterms, which is a great bonus.. I learned sooooooooooo much and the class was worth it all.",,
"Sandoval can be mean to people at times and she calls people out when they did not do anything wrong. The material presented is excellent yet repetitive. The reading is a lot for this class and the quizzes are easy. The four critical essays are easy, but the historical project is hard and unnecessary (especially the Museum of American West part).",,
"Yes, there is ALOT of reading and quite a few papers. Final paper was 11-15 pages of research. I will admit, it's not pleasant to take her, but she does know her stuff. She's also not very approachable. She grades adequately. If you don't like to write, don't take her; although I hate writing and I still got an A!",,
I took her in my sophmore year and I am not a pro at writing. 3 books and one essay for each 1 group project that I hated because she made it seem like a lot of your grade and it was only like 5% and the final is essay making your own theory. Class was intense but I proved to her that I can get an A in the class. &quot;RIGHT&quot;,,
"She isn't that bad. She gives quizes every thursday, but she lets u know exactly what to read for the quiz. No final, just a project/paper: you have to visit a few museums and write a paper. She also gives a few essays (about four) based on the readings. Easy grader.",,
She is so RUDE and unhelpful. Every other word she says is &quot;right&quot; and she thinks she is so good because she got her P.H.D. She does not like female students but pays a lot of attention to the guys. The work is pretty easy but there is a lot of reading and she WILL make you look stupid if you don't know the answer. I would not take her again.,,

Easy class,,
"Yeah, there is some work to do in this class, but not something out if this world. She grades fairly and is willing to help. She is definitely easier that other CHS professors.",,
She has major attitude problem and tried to make me feel stupid when asking questions. She favored her student with a chicano backround and treated the rest of us like seconed rate students. If it were not for her bias grading I would have received a 4.0 but thanks to her B I did not. I was one step short of complaining to the department head.,,

"she does have an attitude, but i managed to get B in the class and i didnt read all the material. I also didnt do the oral presentation. The class is easy just try not to miss any lectures, turn in all the journals, and kinda a avoid her cuz shes ****y( she doesnt like to explain her self twice)",,
"Really easy grader but a lot of reading. Horrible attitude, which creates an uncomfortable classroom environment. Do all the reading, write all the journals, do a 5 minute culture presentation, and put up with her annoying attitude and get an A in the class.",,
"GET RID OF HER!!!!!! SHE IS DISGRACE TO THE CHICANO STUDIES DEPARTMENT!!! That is why she was let go at ELAC, she sucks",,
"Ok, for a 400 level class; this class is not that bad. For just a GE grade (like me) it is super hard. I had to work my ass off for my A-. The class is passable but donå«t expect to miss any classes or do little reading. There are no tests in the class, but the excessive work and reading make up.",,
OMG this lady stresses you alot I got an A but I worked my ass off! not an easy class and not a very likeable professor either...,,
Her lectures helped me to understand some of the material. Only thing I disliked about her was the fact that the papers had to be a certain length or else she wouldn't even bother grading it.,,
"I got an A in this class, but man, was it stressful! The excessive reading and writing wore me out. Sure, a lot is learned (mainly through the reading and writing, not the lectures), but it comes at a high cost. CHS100 with Sandoval should count as a six-units course; that's how demanding it is!",,
No Comments,,
"I am a woman so don't make this a gnedr thing. This is about Sandoval being a horrible teacher.Its clear she loathes being here and disrespects her students. If she doesn't like CSU, she should find another university. She gets an F from a one of her female students.",,

Shut Up and take the easy class. Thats hat we really want.,,
"She is disrespectful,rude,arrogant.Should not be teaching at the university level.Topic could be meaningful but her teaching trivializes and trashes the very importance and essence of Chicano Studies. Didn't learn anything. Her class made me disgusted and turned me off. Avoid her.",,
"prof sandoval is so full of herself we were only allowed to refer to her as dr. sandoval, what a stupid btch",,
"This teacher has no respect for her students. She feels she is very educated scholarly, but when it comes to social skills and treating other with respect she has no skills. She needs to realize that we also deserve respect, just as we give her. She really needs to learn to respect everyone.",,
"this teacher is on a high horse about being chicana, all material is female oriented and singles out all the men in the class. treats intro 100 level class way to strict w, too much work. 2 4p papers, oral and a 6 pg in class final for an intro 100 level course&#63;! extremely moody, and offensive",,
She is a nightmare and a disgrace to the Chicano Studies department. She was terrible at East LA College and here too! Has no clue how to treat people. Terrible,,
"this professor is a total b&*#! she humilates her students and she is not very understanding of their personal problems. &quot;RIGHT&#63;&quot; She marks you tardy if you're late, we are college students here, not high schoolers!!! She needs to learn some social skills, &quot;RIGHT&#63;&quot;",,
No Comments,,
"Avoid her if you can, especially if you are a man. She will not listen to any opinions or comments. She is a major %@&#*! She does not care about her students and will insult you in front of everyone. If you do not go along with her comments or worse state an opposition be prepared to be humiliated.",,

"THIS PROFESSOR IS VERY CLEAR AND THE CLASS IS VERY INTERESTING. I LEARNED SO MUCH IN ONLY ONE SEMESTER. YET, SHE CAN BE A *****. HER ATTITUDE CAN BE A BIT MOODY..",,
No Comments,,
professor Sandoval is a very good teacher. i learned so much about my heritage that i didnt know before i even took her class. She incorporates her youthfullness into her lectures which allow the students to realted...plus she's definitly a hottie.,,
"This teacher is awesome, not to mention beautiful. She is a great person in and out. She grades easy. She requires you to work and learn, but take it from me (someone who doesnt learn very well) you will learn much in her class. You will like it.",,
"She is a beautiful person inside and out. She is very caring and helpful, she gives you helpful study guides and does not throw you off. You actually learn in her class because she is an intelligent and interesting woman. I definetly recommend her",,
"She teaches good. You definetly stay up in her class. Her class reader is specific and well developed, just like her.",,
"Prof Gardner didnt move on until everyone understood. The practice questions that he provides are helpful, do them! Attendance is definitely important for this class. He is entertaining and kept us engaged. There are 4 tests total, not cumulative, no final.",,
"Great professor! Only 4 tests, and no final. A game of jeopardy for extra credit at the end of the semester",,
Doesn't matter if you study or not theres no way you're going to pass this class. Whats in the book and in his lectures is not on the tests at all. No opportunity for extra credit. Has a sign in sheet and if you're 0.2 seconds late he makes you sign the late sheet. You can only be absent once to receive 15 points at the end of the semester.,,
"Amazing professor! His lectures are so much fun! He is hilarious and makes the lectures easy to understand. He explains everything so well! He only grades 4 exams, and attendance. He doesn't collect hw nor its mandatory. He picks a lot of interesting topics out of the book that interested me very well! I would take his class again!",,
"Gardner is an amazing teacher attend the classes and you will do fine. He explains the material very clear. There are only 4 tests and it is not cumulative. His power point and the chapter outlines help, there are readings from the book that helps with the test.",,
OMG THE BEST PROFESSOR EVER!!!! I look forward to his class. His lectures are so much fun!! He lets you take a test then you take a group test again as a group to get a chance to raise score! He gives extra credit if you attend all his classes. TAKE HIM!!,,
"Oh my. God, I love professor Gardner. He makes his class easy to understand, he's so funny, always talking about his wife (Robin), his tests are relatively easy. Just read READ the book. If you do you'll pass with an A. I got a 100% in the class just reading the book and going to class. He also offers extra credit if you don't miss class.",,
"Amazing professor. Super Funny too! You have to show up to every class though. He's tough but he helps you so much. Basically, if you don't want to try then you probably wont pass. I had to study for this class and it was not easy but I passed it because I worked hard. So you can all do it too. I recommend him.",,
"He is such a great guy!! Super funny, makes class fun and enjoyable. I have taken him 4 times and I wish I could keep taking his classes. He cares about his students and will repeat himself numerous times or until you get it to make sure you understand the concept. He is one of my favorite teachers!!",,
"He is really funny and makes complex concepts very understandable. This is the second time Ive taken this class (because my first professor was horrible) and now Im passing with flying colors under Professor Gardner. The class is based on 4 tests (no midterm or final), a fun jeopardy game we play in class, and attendance. I would take him again.",,
"AMAZING!! He is absolutely hilarious and by far my favorite professor. I'm going to take him next semester for 250 because I just loved this class so much. Don't take this class if you aren't a big test taker, in this class it's 4 tests, no final or midterm, really really fun jeopardy. Bottom line, take this class if you're willing to study HARD!",,
"After this psych class I knew i wouldn't be able to major in psychology. Professor Gardner was a hilarious professor. I had him for 8am so it was nice that we laughed. BUT. He lectures from the beginning of class to the end and tends to skip around a lot. He'll be on one topic then change to another. gives 4 tests, kind of confusing.",,
So enthusiastic about the subject really gets the class's attention. Always making jokes I laughed at least once every lecture. At times can lecture too quickly but will go over the material again if some people are still not getting it. Makes topics relatable and is always willing to answer questions. Would love to take this class again! 4 exams,,
"He is a great professor. Only problem is that he speaks fast, and his study guides do not help for exams. You might as well just look over your notes. He is very funny and makes the material interesting. Not very difficult.",,
"He is the BEST professor I have ever had. Funny, and really cares if the students comprehend what's being lectured on. Only four exams. The Psychology department requires 20 credits of experiments, but he's helpful with those too. Take him for any Psych class he is teaching. You will not regret it!",,
"Highly recommended. Show up to class and take notes. Exams mostly based off lectures, but some questions come from the text. Hilarious and a great person. Passionate about psychology and Robin.",,
"He does not teach! 4 tests, one jeopardy game which is so unfair. His class is only entertaining, you have to read the chapters 3 weeks before the test because its so much reading. I won't recommend. Has a sign in sheet, if you're late by one minute you are considered late. 6 lates equal to 1 absence.",,
"Super easy to get along with; there are no group projects however he gives students an opportunity to raise their grades right after an exam is taken. He uses great analogies to describe difficult concepts and is in general a very charming and funny person. 10/10 recommend Professor Gardner, and I will be sure to take his PSY250 class next semester",,
you take about 14 quizzes which is about the power points the week of. Pretty easy if you study the power point. You do not really need he textbook.,,
"Professor Gardner is fantastic! He's enthusiastic, smart, funny, and helpful. Show up to class for notes and attendance points. 4 Test total, non-cumulative, no final and midterms and one jeopardy game. There is an experiment thing require by the psychdep. It's a fairly easy class if you study and go to class, but he makes class worth it!",,
"Pay attention and show up for extra credit. He tends to jump around in his lectures, therefore do the 'homework' he assigns, if you want. 'Homework' is not collected. Only 4 tests. No final. Extra Credit Jeopardy 1 time in semester. First you take tests individually then in groups. If your score is close to the group score, you get the higher grade",,
He's super funny! and really cool. But attendance is mandatory and his tests are tough. You must read the chapters in order to pass his 4 tests because the lectures are not enough. There is a Jeopardy game that is no longer EC but mandatory for points. those are your only chances for points which makes the class hard cause you MUST do well on exams,,
"No mandatory homework, 4 (33 questions) multiple choice tests, one jeopardy game for extra cred (1st place receives 60 points), no final, super easy stuff. He provides a lot of examples. 'Mandatory attendance' for extra credit. Come to class and take notes. I passed all tests with 100% because he gave extra credit group testing after each of them.",,
Gardner is very enthusiastic! He really does make learning psychology fun and the videos that we watch are very helpful. But reading the book is crucial to passing the class. His tests are easy if you take good notes and read the book. He gives you assigned readings so that's helpful/ His tests are so weird and tricky so you need to know the stuff,,
"Professor Gardner is incredibly enthusiastic during his lectures making it easy to stay focused. He also has a great way of breaking down the concepts taught, making it easier to understand. His exams are fairly easy, whatever is mentioned in class is most likely to be seen on the exam along w/ some stuff from the readings! He's a great guy!",,
"Gardner is amazing, there's no other way to put it. He's hilarious, kind, entertaining, knowledgeable, and really understands his students. Best professor I've ever had! We only had 4 exams /semester and no final. I always looked forward to being in class, I knew I was going to have a great time laughing and learning fascinating concepts. Take him!",,
"He is probably one of the best professors I have ever had so far. He mixes humor and learning, which makes the info a little bit easier to digest and remember. He doesn't do a final, which is nice. His tests are okay and straightforward as long as you at least try to learn the lesson.",,
His class is one of the best I've taken! There is no homework although he does tells you which pages to read from the textbook to learn more about his lecture. Tests are easier than expected and his lectures are really fun!,,
"Best PSYCH Teacher ever!!! He is so nice, funny, awesome, and amazing! He should be an actor! His lectures are very interesting, his class is so much fun. And plus you will learn a lot in his class! No homework, just 4 tests. But you still have to study. But he always tells u wat to read and sections will be in the test! Highly recommend",,
BEST PSYCH TEACHER EVER! You must take his class! It's super easy and he never assigns homework! It also means you really gotta study and at least skim through the assigned chapters.,,
"Awesome psych teacher, he is really passionate about what he teaches. He loves to get his students involved in class examples. Sometimes he can go a little off topic. Only readings and exams in this class so be ready to read! Love him and would take him again.",,
"He made time for you during office hours and made concepts clear. He gives good examples, but tests can be confusing because of the way he words it. His lectures are funny, but the power point information is dull. I personally would not take his class again.",,
He is one of the worst teachers i have ever taken..... his test are confusing and his lectures are dull. He's one of those professors that doesn't care about his students as well.,,
"Prof. Gardner is hilarious and a genius. He keeps the class awake and entertained. Though, his lectures are pretty confusing and we hardly took notes in class. He usually just assigns us readings from the book, and tells us to take notes based on the reading. The tests are difficult and tricky, but if you go to his office hours he will help you.",,
"Professor Gardner is hilarious! Make sure to take notes and use that as study guide, because it will be on the tests. There are only four tests, and you have to be present all the time. If you're late twice, that would count as one absence and he will deduct points for every absence. Then, there's a jeopardy game that really helps your grade!",,
"Prof. Gardner is the best!! 4 exams. No homework. Just read ahead, skim and pace yourselves throughout so you fully understand his lessons. His powerpoint is your psych study guide for exams. Not much scribbling; just remember the concepts & terms. He's a genius. So take him when you can! Bonus: funny funny guy and amazing and interesting lectures!",,
"This class is not ordinary. He has 4 tests total which count for your whole grade. Attendance is MANDATORY. He makes you sign in at the beginning and gives you extra points at the end of the semester if your attendance is great, trust, you will need those points. Get ready to read the book because there is really no lecture and no notes in class.",,
"Prof. Gardner is very fun and entertaining. His lectures are a little confusing, but if you read the book you should be fine. He sometimes provides study guides or outlines, but DO NOT go based on what is on there because sometimes the test is nothing like it. It is really hard to get a C or higher on his test. Best of Luck!",,
"Gardner is a great professor, he is entertaining and shows passion on the subject. Though the test are pretty difficult. You really have to read the books in order to pass the tests. There are 4 midterms, no final. I would recommend him for psych 150, but for psych 250 i think another professor would be best.",,
"Love this teacher, he's the funniest teacher I ever had. No homework or quizzes, only 4 tests and psychology experiments (which are easy). The tests are somewhat difficult, but if you attend every class you'll do fine since he doesn't test on anything he hasn't talked about in class. It's a lot of reading. You'll enjoy his lectures though!",,
"he is a great person, hilarious and entertaining. but it is a tough class. he gets on you if you begin taking notes and tells you to just listen to him not write but you will do horribly on the tests like that. TAKE NOTES. at least try. he lectures at a very fast pace so try your best to scribble notes. tests can be tough. only 4 tests",,
I would suggest this professor to everyone around because he makes it specific as to what you need to study to pass and disregards other information. He's funny which makes the lecture much more enjoyable and uses examples that we could relate too. To get an A you have to work for it but it's doable. If you have the chance take this professor,,
"I passed this class with a C only because I studied like three days before each test. I suggest you take notes during lecture but write short phrases, he lectures at a fast paste. Skim through the book before lectures and read thoroughly after but make sure it connects to the lectures or you'll read extra unimportant stuff.",,
"He was such a hilarious professor and made the topics connect with real life. There was 4 tests, no final, and you have to participate in experiments to pass the class or do the essay. Overall, great class!",,
"This guy is all over the place. Tells us not to take any notes and does not provide study guides. When it comes to the exams, nothing seems relevant. More than half of the class gets a C or less on every exam. This is the first time I take a professor who is careless and my GPA dropped because of it. AVOID HIM IF YOU CAN!",,
"Gardner is a funny guy. Mostly lectures and once in awhile plays videos. Pay attention to everything he says because it WILL be on the test. Just take notes in class and go over it in the textbook later and you'll be fine but also skim through the other chapters. 4 exams 40 or less questions, no final, allows one make up exam and a day of jeopardy",,
"Not allowed to take notes you are only suppose to listen to his lectures but they are all over the place. He is not concrete at all he says one thing and then says something completely different the next day. Mostly shows videos in class, only 4 exams and they hard because he does not specify what is going to be on so you are on your own. The Worst",,
"I took Dr. G for Psych 250 & passed. I'd advise the students to not let his fun lectures distract them from reading along in the book for those lectures. Many students who struggled on tests, which are tough, were struggling because they were not reading the book. He's full of energy, loves his job, and will help you with specifics in Office Hours.",,
"book NOT required for class. grade is based on FOUR tests. no final. attendance is extra credit. usually talks (occasionally writes things down) the whole class. also shows lots of videos. since he talks the whole class, make sure you're paying attention to key points he mentions in class. reading the book helps A LOT.",,
"TAKE HIM! Loves his subject, tests are ONLY OFF OF LECTURES. Book is just a guideline. 4 tests, NO FINAL, NO HOMEWORK. Attendance is important, if you miss less than 2 classes, you get extra points. Took 8am and he really wakes you up. Encourages questions, tests are easy, DEFINITELY not boring, makes class fun! Definitely would take him again.",,
"Love this teacher! His class is on opposite side of campus from my dorm and its at 8am, but his lectures makes me want to go to class. Class laughing every class. He is very passionate about psychology and he's a pretty laidback teacher. Attendance is mandatory if you want to pass this class since tests are based on his lectures. Love his class!",,
"He definitely woke me up every morning at 8. He's so cool and makes the lectures not boring. The tests aren't hard but they are weird & you have to listen well in lectures & probably skim the book.Only 4 tests, no real final or homework. Take him!",,
"Gardner is one of the best Psych professors you will encounter. He is not only goofy but his funny stories make you understand the material much better and it actually sticks in your head. His tests are very fair. READ THE BOOK in advance. He gives out four tests, NO FINAL. I found his class to be very easy but you have to study!!",,
"Gardner was awesome, He clearly loves what he is doing. Gives lots of examples, write those down, they will help you remember. His tests are not like any other professor, they're actually kind of silly, If you study you'll do great. He tends to go off on tangents during his lectures, it can get confusing, but don't hesitate to ask questions.",,
Fun class! Very energetic professor. Just review your notes before tests and you should be fine!,,
He is really hard and confusing. He changes topics a lot. Made me hate the class.,,
"Prof. Gardner is the best psy professor! He's full of energy and makes the class entertaining. He makes the material easier than it is. He encourages asking questions, please ask if something isn't clear. There are 4 tests and no final! Attend his classes and read the book! and that will help you get a good grade. Take him!!!",,
"He's a great teacher, easy class if you pay attention and do the readings, you wont be bored. He's really funny.",,
"Mike is awesome. He's really funny and tries to keep the class engaged at all times. Always responds to questions, he encourages them. His tests are easy as long as you go to class. Don't even think twice about it, take him for whatever class.",,
He did a great job of keeping us entertained. He tends to 'act out' all his lectures. You will feel like you're watching a play or something lol (I dont know how he always has the energy for it). But you will not be bored. Take him if you can.,,
"He is a great professor. The only reason why I didn't give him a 5/5 is that he's not the all-around perfect professor. His tests are easy if you pay attention in class/take notes. Grades on a curve, so your grades are probably going to end up better than they actually are. He keeps the class fun and interesting. Downside: his classes are large.",,
"take him. third sem here @ csun and he'ss the best professor i've had. Clear, hilarious an keeps you in tact the entire class.",,
"HILARIOUS! I LOVE HIM EVEN THOUGH I DIDNT GET A GOOD GRADE BUT WHATEVER, I EXTREMELY RECOMMEND!",,
"HE IS LITERALLY THE BEST PSYCH TEACHER EVER! IF YOU GET HIM YOU WILL LOVE HIM! PRETTY EASY, HE IS EXTREMELY FUNNY AND HE GIVES EXAMPLES THAT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND AND YOU WILL LOOK FORWARD TO GOING TO HIS CLASS. ALL YOU NEED ARE YOUR NOTES AND HIS TESTS ARE BASICALLY NOTES AND NO DEFINITIONS AT ALL! PIECE OF CAKE! :D",,
Gardner is awesome. If he were my professor for every class I would not complain!,,
Hands down the best professor I've had at csun. If you're looking for an easy GE you've found it. Attendance is mandatory but his lectures are never boring. Don't waste your money on the book. I never opened mine and I got 100's on every test. Take detailed notes on his lectures and review them before the tests. Warning: he sweats a lot.,,
"Prof. Gardner was the funniest / coolest tacher I have ever had at CSUN. Going to class was like watching a comedian and I always looked forward to his class. YOU MUST STUDY FROM THE BOOK otherwise you will probably get only C's on the tests, which are easy if you read the chapters. Highly recommend this teacher.",,
"An overall great Professor, but the test were confusing for me. I followed the lectures and book, but the style of the test(s) weren't my cup of tea. Don't bother reading the book like myself. The tests are based on the lectures, and if you see an answer on the test from the book or lectures go with from the lecture notes. I made that mistake.",,
"All lectures and tests. 4 tests and a jeopardy game. No extra credit! He's funny don't get me wrong but not so helpful if you go to his office hours. If you are not a good guesser or test taker, DO NOT take his class! You MUST read your book and take notes in class to what he says. Write down his examples too!",,
Best Professor I've had at CSUN. As long as you go to class you should do fine in his class. He's really funny and makes the class interesting at 8 am,,
IT IS PRIMARILY LECTURES AND TEST NO EXTRA CREDIT GIVEN. SO IF YOUR NOT A TEST TAKER DONT GO. GOING TO HIS OFFICE HOURS WILL NOT DO ANY JUSTICE HE DEFIANTLY DOESN'T WORK WITH YOU IF YOUR A STRUGGLE TEST TAKER. HIS TEST ARE DESIGNED TO BE FUNNY BUT ARE IRRITATING,,
"The most interesting professor, you will definitely not be bored in his class. He makes the subject easy to understand. It was a fun class. And the test are all multiple choice. That's a bonus. ;)",,
"The most energetic, hillarious professor you'll ever meet. Had him 8am M/W, which would normally be awful, but I looked forward to his class every week!Great guy, answers emails back quickly, and you get your test grades the same day! Couldn't imagine taking Psych with anyone else...I learned SO much! Highly recommend!",,
"I absolutely LOVED this guy. I'm almost certain he has ADHD but his teaching style is awesome. He doesn't hand out lame papers to write either. Show up to class, take good notes while being entertained at the same time, and then Ace his tests. A helpful hint: write down the examples he gives and study those. Gardner's the MAN!",,
"AMAZING. ENTERTAINING. Going to class is like going to a comedy show. Bring your coffee, sit back, and prepare to be entertained while learning! Silly jokes, stories, and all relevant to the topic. He is so passionate about what he does. Just great. Easy, only a few tests, noncumulative.",,
I LOVE THIS PROFESSOR!!! He is the greatest! His class is easy if you pay attention and go over the book. Attendence is mandatory but he makes his class fun and interesting. He is really funny and he knows the subject well. Definetly recomend taking him if you can,,
"I LOVE THIS PROFESSOR! I'm taking his biopsych class, and even though the material is a lot to take in, he is a super friendly, upbeat dude. He definitely makes class interesting and I actually look forward to going for once.",,
Extremely funny guy esp. for an 8 am class on M/W. 5 exams. I liked the subject but I felt his exams were extremely difficult no matter how hard I studied. Got the same grade on each exam. Exams based off examples and not definitions. It's a fun but really demanding class that requires you to put so much study time in to prepare for the exams.,,
"I love Mike Gardner! The 1st and last test are the most difficult ones. There's no final and the 2nd and 3rd tests are not too bad. Read the book and take good notes in class. He always says 'use your notes as a guideline' so whatever he mentions in class, make sure you read about it in the book. It's challenging, but office hours helps a lot.",,
"My favorite teacher by far this semester! Very funny, intelligent man. I took his 8 am class thinking I would be struggling to stay awake, however Gardner does an excellent job of keeping students awake and involved in his lectures. Explains material thoroughly, shows cool videos in class, cracks funny jokes, and keeps you on your toes!",,
Amazing professor so energetic and funny! but it does require tons of studying and reading to pass! I loved the class! I didn't pass but that was my fault for the low effort I portrayed in his class. so if you are ready for a challenge go for him he is great overall,,
Mike was fantastic. Really made the material easy to learn and very clear. Attendance is very necessary because he bases the tests mostly on what he talks about in class.,,
"Gardner is the best! Challenging class but it was my favorite last semester. The four tests are taken from everything he says in class so you have to go. No matter what-be in class. No final, that's nice! He's hilarious and has a lot of energy. I would love to take him again if I could.",,
HE is a very interesting professor and he is very funny. Buy the book it is your bible read every section he tells you to read and go to class everyday to uerstand what the book is talking about better.,,
"He is full of energy, which was really weird for an 8 am class. This class is not extremely difficult, but if you dont put effort in, you will not pass. 4 tests in total, plus a bunch of points for showing up and playing jeapordy. He tries to make everything is understood by everyone. Overall the most energetic professor i have ever had.",,
"Mike is the best!! I wasn't looking forward to waking up early for a 8am class, but after the first day I didn't mind at all! His lectures are full of energy & he tries to make everything understandable. When others say he sweats, they aren't lying. He sweats A LOT and he tells you that the first day. Read the book & attend class-you'll do fine.",,
He is really funny and interesting teacher. I failed but that was because I didn't read ahead nor did I study for tests. There are 4 test in total and no final.,,
"Absolutely fantastic and interesting teacher. I can't say I did too well on the tests, but that's definitely because I didn't read the book, and the tests aren't what make the class good - it's absolutely fantastic if you're thinking about psychology but aren't quite sure yet. Basically, if you're going for entry level psych, Mike all the way.",,
just an awsome prof. and gets his point across with some jokes,,
"I dont know what these people are talking about. Gardner is the best professor ever. Yes, he sweats but he is the BEST professor at CSUN. He makes you want to learn about the subject and makes calss anything but boring. If i could have him for every class I would. AMAZING PROFESSOR!",,
"Gardner is one animated professor, he sweats like a dog and jumps all over the place. Attendance is mandatory but youll want to go because he is entertaining. however, attending the lectures does not help whatsoever with the tests, the textbook will save you, READ IT, LOVE IT.",,
"Very entertaining! His lectures are very interesting and he makes them understandable by relating them to things that apply to you. His tests can be a bit difficult, but if you show up to class and read the text it's easy. You even get 12 points for attendance. Also, no final for this class which is amazing ! Highly recommended !",,
He is really passionate about teaching BUT its impossible to get an A in this class. I had a 4.0 GPA but i got a C in the class after hours and hours of studying. His tests are really difficult.,,
The textbook is your best friend! Make sure you buy it and read it!!!,,
"Very energetic, he wont bore you thats for sure! The subject was interesting if you like neuroscience, I loved his class and I learned soooo much from it, but his exams are definitely difficult, take notes even if he says dont take notes and make sure to read every chapter in the book!",,
"Really good lectures. He teaches you a lot without really trying to &quot;teach&quot; in the traditional way. He wants you to understand concepts, not memorize a bunch of junk you'll forget and never use. Always an interesting and fun class. He's full of energy and gives a lot or real world examples to illustrate his points. One of the best!",,
"I have chosen Gardner for 3 PSY courses because he keeps the whole class interested in the subject, he makes psychology FUN and he doesn't mind repeating himself or giving alternate examples that apply to the modern world. EXCELLENT PROFESSOR. He is definitely one of my favorites, and he will always keep you awake in class with his sense of humor.",,
"Gardner is God! Honestly one of the best psychology professors at CSUN. He is so much fun and even if you take him early in the morning you will have no problem waking up with all of his energy. The class material may seem difficult, but as long as you go to every class and READ THE BOOK. You'll get A's on every test like I did. RECOMMEND!",,
"Gardener ALWAYS has so much energy! He is a really good teacher, and always uses good examples to connect the concepts to our every day life. He doesn't believe in definitions, only learning concepts, so you don't have to memorize definitions. The class is really interesting and it never feels like 3hrs and 25 mins!",,
"Gardner is a riot! He will always always ALWAYS make you laugh and keep you interested in the subject. He is very happy to be a professor and has a really good attitude every class session! Make sure you read and go to class and you will be fine! However, if you do not go to class then he will take points off of your grade so be careful!",,
"Great professor and brilliant man. He talks super fast, no one has time to take notes, it takes a few classes to get used to. Browse the textbook on sections he suggests but mostly attend class and pay attention. I don't have a taste for bio so this was one of the hardest psych classes I've taken",,
"Gardner is brilliant!! Sure, he's crazy and fast talking, but a genius nonetheless. I took him for 250 and again for 352. He doesn't really like note takers but take them anyway because you'll need them. The exams are pretty difficult so MAKE SURE to read thoroughly. Tests are 35ish q's but he makes them out of like 28 because he knows they're hard",,
"I had this prof for psy 150 and it was easy, fun and good. I expected the same for 352 but nope. His lectures barely reflect the tests, sure he goes over the book but his questions are so dumb. Maybe 352 is the class he cant really teach, a lot is learned but tests will kill u.",,
There are 4 exams in this class. There is no HW assigned and the class grade is based only on 4 exams. Attendance is Mandatory & he does take roll. We must also do 5 Credits of Psychology Experiments. His exams are difficult & he lectures very fast. He exams consist of both lecture and textbook. He's very energetic & a fast talker.,,
"Gardner is one of my favorite teachers for his enthusiasm and his love for teaching. Although, I do have to admit that his tests are difficult if you don't read the book so just sit down and read. Plus he will tell you not to write anything down when he lectures, but do it anyway. You will definitely need the notes.",,
This guy is a comic. I mean a real comic. I enjoyed his comedy but when it came to him teaching I was so frustrated. I mean CSUN?s professors are really slacking. My professors in community college were much better. His lectures are useless and he tells you not to write anything down. His exams consist of 30 questions that don?t make sense. He also,,
"I went into this class so interested, he was interesting and funny.When it came down to the his testing method, everything that I had studied for wasn't there. They are worded so tricky. He's all over the place. I got a C, it messed up my GPA. I've been a 3.0 and above, since I started CSUN. I would run away. Stay away from this class .",,
Material was interesting u learn about the brain and all the parts and funcions His exams are difficult! u gota put time and effort into it to get a good grade. I got an A in the class but i studied by butt off! His tests are 75% book and the other 25 notes. He adds points after each tests to help you. You MUST really actually study or else ull fai,,
"I'm a psy major. Recommend! Knowledgeable, energetic, enjoys teaching, encourages &quot;ALL&quot; questions. Attend & LISTEN to lec. & read the text. Tests are multipule choice & no papers to write. Enjoyable experience!",,
he has lots of energy! his test are easy as long as you pay attention and READ the book on your own time. the only hard part is actually taking time to sit down on your own time and read. it's only one book though. I would recommend him since he isn't a boring professor. he makes his topics fun and interesting.,,
"Gardner is an amazing professor! I never leave class without laughing at least 5 times. He is witty and cheerful, and excited about Psychology! Definitely take him for psyche 150 and 250, just make sure to read the book! because his lectures are pretty much based on the book! YAY!!!!",,
He's an interesting professor but his tests are HARD. He talks really fast and is known to go off topic all the time. I had him for Motivation and just got by. Take Elias instead.,,
"Assumes you already have advanced knowledge of the brain and all neurological functions. Tests are impossible at best even after copious notes and hours of study. Wonderful person, however, disorganization and fast speech confuse students. Needs to have reliable study guides and reasonable tests.",,
"Here is the deal, he is a good professor, IF you do benefit learning from bunch of videos; because i dont!!!! he only talks like 20% of the semester and all 80% he leaves it all on the screen, i can't learn from that way. take him if u can benefit from movies.",,
"Good prof.He talks really fast & it's hard to keep up sometimes,but is helpful if you have questions.He makes things interesting,even tho some of the videos can be boring. Tests are from notes&book and can be kind of difficult so make sure you go to class, take good notes, & study.He does reviews the class before a test so use that as a study guide",,
his lecture were unorganized. very hard to understand what section we are discussing. as long as you read the book and study it really well u can do good. his lectures did not help. he is a fun hyper and energetic professor he is nice,,
"Amazing Teacher!! Not your basic lectures, Gardner is clearly passionate about Psychology! I had him for Psy 150 and made sure to sign up for his 250 course. Though he is an amazing teacher be sure to read the book because his tests are based off of them. His lectures are only meant to give you an easier, relaxed example of what the book says.Take!",,
"Professor Gardner speaks very fast and uses very basis vocab and language in his lectures. However, his tests are very hard and uses textbook/professional vocabulary and are not reflected from the lectures. Your grade comes from your tests; no research papers or extra credit opportunities. I would not recommend it unless you're a great test taker.",,
"Professor Gardner is in my opinion, an average professor. He is very passionate about the subject but frequently loses his train of thought while lecturing and speaks very quickly. He says not to take notes but without them you are likely to fail all of the tests of which there are four with no final. Make sure you keep up with your reading!",,
"Funny, interesting, and actually cares about the subject. Be sure to read!",,
"Hard class. He is all over the map during the lectures. You will need to use the book to help fill in the gaps because you won't be able to take notes fast enough. Also, he will say something is not going to be on the test, then it turns up -so study EVERYTHING. If you have a great memory for details, you will do alright. Not an easy A.",,
"Talks way to fast, swear has ADD, jumps topics a lot. Hard to focus. Have to basically read book and borrow notes from others. Can't record his lectures. Records attendance before and after. Paper assignment is included. He loves subject but not a great teacher. I have a 3.7 GPA and struggled with this class, this was my only B.",,
"Prof. Gardner is without a doubt the best teacher I've ever had. His classes are amazing, he is hilarious, and his tests are based on his lectures. So, if you go to class you get an easy A. Try to take every class you can with him, you won't regret it!!! He's the best of the best.",,
"BAD PROFESSOR! I'M AN A AND B STUDENT AND I FAILED THIS CLASS. NO STUDY GUIDES OR ANYTHING, YOU'RE PRACTICALLY ON YOUR OWN!",,
"Even though I passed the class I can't out of experience possible recommend him to anyone else. He's remarkably impossible to comprehend most of the time and will make your brain have pain even though the brain doesn't have pain receptors. Maybe he's better when it's not a one day class, but if it is, seriously, don't take him. You won't learn.",,
"I think this guy was rated highly because of the group tests he USED 2 give that would boost ur grade. This is the 1st time n 3yrs. That I can safely say I learned nothing. He talks extremely fast, tells u not 2 take notes, makes u watch videos that aren't avail. n the lib, and the book is useless 4 tests which makeup ur total grade. Learned= nada",,
"He's a fun professor, but talks too fast! Even if you do take notes and read the book the grade you studied for isn't going to be what you want b/c this class is that bad. Take him if you must.",,
This class is very hard but he was a great teacher. he explains everything until you understand completely. if you show up to the class and pay attention you'll pass.but you have to take notes even though he say you don't need them. there is no final he doesn't believe in them so that's a plus. overall great teacher and really funny i recommend him,,
"The subject itself is hard. But the professor is fun and a real nice guy.He is very approachable. He tries to help by lowering the test grades. 4 test, but no final",,
"Professor Gardner is awesome! I wish he taught every subject. He is fun and lively; there is never a dull moment in class. He LOVES what he does.The tests are STRAIGHT from the lecture. It's good to read ahead from the book before the lecture. Attendance is mandatory, and if you attend every day, you get extra credit, which really helps.RECCOMMEND!",,
He is one of the best teachers I have ever taken. I looked forward for his class. He is funny and his test are easy if you pay attention take good notes and read the book.,,
"Attendance is mandatory! Read the book and take good notes, he talks REALLY fast. Tests are a bit hard and he didn't really cover as much in lecture due to time. Gardner is a class act though, definitely take his class.",,
"He's a really great professor. He talks really fast though. His tests are conceptual, take a lot of notes and read the chapters!!! Read them more then once. Take the online quizzes because he uses a few questions from there on tests. Overall Gardner is a really funny professor and he's really nice.",,
"Very fast talking professor that is unclear at times. I didn't like this class personally, but it depends on the person. He has 4 tests and doesn't believe in midterms or finals. I would rather take this course online if it was offered at the time.",,
"If you like energetic, crazy, fast-talking professors then you will love Gardner. I absolutely loved this class. Gardner made me look forward to Monday mornings. There is no final and no midterm because he doesn't believe in cramming for one huge test. I didnt use the book all that much and did Fine. I didnt even need a lot of notes. RECOMMENDED!",,
"Gardner's a very entertaining professor, attendence IS MANDATORY but he keeps your interest.. TAKE NOTES!!!! his tests are ALL from the notes and he talks really really fast so pay attentions..",,
"Highly recommend Professor Gardner. Read the textbook before the lectures if you can, it helps. He says not to take notes, but I suggest you do--to study for the tests. Don't fall behind on the required Psych Experiments.",,
"funny, crazy, energetic & very entertaining. this class isnt super easy though. there were 4 tests, a game of jeopardy, and no final. he takes attendance. i worked my butt off taking notes from both his lectures and the book. i did well on all the exams except 1. i expected an A and ended up with a B+ kinda disappointing for a overachiever like me",,
YOU MUST ATTEND CLASS!!!! This class is based on notes. You must take good notes in order to pass the exams. This professor can be fun but he is also demanding. Not recommend for those that like to stay home and just read the book.,,
"He's not for everybody, but great for people who attend regularly and listen well. Gardner is a fun guy, knows his stuff, very energetic, tries to keep it interesting. I want to take another class with him; I paid attention, and I got an A. If you skip class regularly, though, you will be screwed on tests.",,
"I recommend taking Gardner. He is entertaining and makes the class fun. The truth is I would not go to class that often but the tests werent that hard. The only reason I would do ok on the test is because I would REMEMBER his lectures (he gives examples to help us understand)and of course theres a paper, its an upper division class (what u expect&#63;)",,
Most amazing professor ever. Definitely knows his stuff. He's so funny and class was always interesting. Textbook is absolutely mandatory though and tests were tricky and kind of hard. But definitely recommend! You can't not love him!,,
"I took him for Psy 150 because he isnt as boring as other professors. He talks extremely fast and is very unorganized with his lectures. You can't possibly take notes, even the interpreters for the deaf had a hard time keeping up. if you study from what you can catch while he lectures and the reading, you can pass for sure. attendance is mandatory",,
"Dr. Gardner is great. Its hard to find a professor nowadays that genuinely has a passion for teaching and cares about his students. His students are a little difficult, but if you attend class and read the book, you'll do fine. I highly recommend Gardner. He's great :)",,
"Dr. G is very dedicated to his job. He is VERY enthusiastic about teaching psychology and really encourages his students to participate in his lectures. You MUST attend class; his notes are vital to the tests. His tests are VERY hard. If you like biology, take him. If not, take someone else.",,
"THE GREATEST PROF EVER! HE IS HILARIOUS! his class is a bit challenging but who doesn't love a good challenge&#63;! you MUST take notes and study them cuz thats where he gets his exam from. if youre a good note-taker than CONGRATS this is the class for you! if youre not a good note-taker, THEN LEARN!",,
"Greatest teacher ever! He is absolutely hilarious. Makes the class very fun, interesting, and explains everything really well. Kinda hard to take notes, but as long as you read and understand the material you will do fine. Psychology is already interesting for me, and he just makes me want to suck on the nipple of psychology. you MUST take him!!!!",,
So as a psych major everyone told me to take 250 with this guy. according to every other person on csun who has taken 150 he is amazing and hillarious. WRONG! he's not funny but annoying. he's a horrible professor. you can study the book as much as you want but the tests are based on his lecture and you CANNOT take notes with him. DONT TAKE,,
best class of the day. he is so funny and he explains things perfectly. you remember so much without really having to take notes. he makes the subject really interesting and relateable too.,,
One of the greatest professors I've had!,,
"The truth must be told. Gardner is an entertaining professor, but that's all. His nice personlaity isn't a good replacement for his unreasonably fast talking habit, his lecturing style that makes note taking almost impossible, his policy on attendance, his disorganize lectures. Good man but has issues when it comes to teaching.",,
Real fun and interesting professor..makes class fun and is very helpful. class consist of daily lectures and only three exams.. no final..,,
BEST PROFESSOR EVER! he is so funny and makes the class great. its the type of class you wouldnt mind waking up early to attend. highly recommended. :),,
"HE'S GREAT!!! He is my favorite teacher at CSUN so far. He is really nice and funny. I have never been a straight A student but I got 100% on 3 out of 4 of his tests! The way I did it is by showing up to every class and taking notes, if you do that you're golden! He makes information relevant and interesting",,
"A very good teacher. He understands the way most students learn, though this class may be hard if the only thing you know how to do is study a textbook. Tests are based on lecture, not the book. I'd recommend maybe borrowing the txt instead of buying if this is your GE, cuz its more supplemental than anything. Show up, listen and pass. =)",,
Showing up for class is mandatory.Hes really funny and his lectures are important when you are there you know what he covered so the day before the test just read the book over and you should be fine. Dont really have to know terms and definitions either. Super easy when you get a hang of his test.,,
mike gardner is the BEST professor! i enjoyed his class so much! as long as you pay attention in class and read a bit of the book before the tests you should be fine! its cool cuz you get to take tests in groups! i loved this class! grade is only based on tests and be sure to not be late or absent. i got an A!,,
"Gardner is an entertaining professor but very bad at teaching. He talks way too fast which doesn't make it easy to take notes in class. Notes are VERY necessary for tests, which are waaay too hard for the what he teaches.I got a b+ so his class is very do-able...just hard to keep invloved in the class. I wouldn't consider taking him again.",,
tests are confusing and if you are late 3 times he counts it as one abense if you have more then 3 you marks off points. you'll have a 10 page paper due at the end of the semester,,
"This was an extremely fun class. Mike is very interactive and really wants you to do well. This is one of those rare classes where you will get there 5 minutes early every time. Its like listening to a comedian for an hour, and then passing the test. The tests are only hard if you haven't gone to lectures.",,
"GREAT!! Yes, his test are hard for people who do not come to class!! If you are there and review your book, based on his lectures, you will do good in class. He will ask you over & over if you understand what he is saying, if you don't, don't be shy he will explain it until you do!! EXTRA POINTS, if you missed less than 2 classes!!!",,
ya hes funny but that doesnt help for you to get a good grade. he also takes puts off if your absent...,,
This professor is amazing! He is hilarious and makes it very fun to learn. He explains things very clearly and provides exactly what you need for each test. I really looked forward to coming to this class. My favorite class by far! I highly recommend this professor!,,
"If you have to be at class at 8am, this is the guy you want to listen to. Fun, well prepared, high energy. Very little homework, test prep is excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed the class -- wish he taught more upper division!",,
"mike is awesome!funny and relevant!does talk fast, but his humor helps you remember it all.if you don't get it, go to office hours or read! i didn't. i only studied 3 hours the whole semester and got an A. listen, take notes, and you'll do fine. only complaint is that he ALWAYS has sweaty pit-stains. great guy, amazing teacher. needs antiperspirant",,
No Comments,,
"So great! Take him if you ever get the chance. He is so animated and brings the material to life! So funny and into the material that you can't help but learn a bunch from him! Great, great, great!",,
take somebody else. tests are hard and a 10 page paper,,
"Great teacher, very funny. Interesting subject...it actually MOTIVATES you, and at 8am, you need that.",,
"TUST ME AND DONT TAKE THIS CLASS!!yeah he's funny,and entertaining,but you learn nothing during the lectures, and you need to learn everything your self!the book is BORING!you have four tests ad he drops none of them,no curves!They are hard,and unless you read word for word,and between the lines,you wont even pass(C)!i studied so much and got a C-!",,
"I wouldn't take him again. I had to read the book and the tests are very confusing. The 10 page paper that we had to write, weren't even graded fairly. cuz he didn't do it he has a TA doing his stuff. Take my advice, you'll be doing all the work on your own. I didn't pay money for me to only read the book and understand nothing from the lectures.",,
This teacher is absolutely amazing. He hardly makes you use the book you just have to listen to the lecture. He is funny as hell trust me.he talks really fast but has the funniest examples and actions your stomach will hurt. The tests are hard but just pay attenetion you&quot;ll only be there for like 40 min anyway. VERY GOOD,,
"Wonderful teacher!Without a doubt, take him!Need to read the book,but can pass without reading!Alot of the material is common sense. Every class was like going to a comedy club for free!=)Would take him again if I could!!",,
The man is a disaster!He's all over the place!His lectures are not clear and I didn't feel like he covered much of the book.,,
"easy class, and interesting. i actually looked forward going to this class every morning. the tests are easy as long as you study and pay attention in class. HE IS A VERY FUNNY DUDE, he will make you laugh daily guaranteed.",,
Funniest guy ever! Lectures are really interesting. There is a writing requirement paper and four tests total. You'll do fine as long as you read the notes and the summary section of the book.,,
he is so much fun. this is the only class that i looked foward in actually going there is only four tests and no finals,,
"This guy rocks, I took him at Valley and was able to take him here for my gen ed",,
GREAT teacher! very energetic and hilarious. Just pay very close attention to his lectures and read the book. can't go wrong with gardner.,,
Great teacher! You won't regret taking him if you want that A,,
Yes yes yes. This was the only class at CSUN I've ever WANTED to go to. He's hilarious and makes the information really easy to understand.,,
"I've taken 2 of Dr. Gardner's classes and I find them simply amazing! He is such a great professor. Even if you dont receive a good grade, you'll absorb so much info and he makes it so easy and fun! Great class",,
He was one of the best teachers i've ever had at CSUN. He talks constantly about his wife and makes the whole class laugh.,,
"This guy is hilarious. Very fun teacher, very fun class. There are only 4 tests and that's it. The tests are difficult tho, so that can be a good or bad thing. You MUST read, you MUST study. But he makes biopsych as interesting as it could possibly be. Love him!",,
He is a good teacher but you have to read the book to do well in the class. You have four test in his class and that's your grade.,,
u have to read ahead to pass the class. other then that he is a funny guy,,
"His lectures are funny and interesting, but useless. Doesn't help in the exam. and signing the attendence sheet is such a pain (imagine if you were only late for 3 mins). You'll need to read the textbook before exams.",,
"His class was very interesting. it definitely woke me up in the morning. He was very energetic and enthusiastic about what he was teaching.the tests are off the lectures,but read the book to go into detail if you want an A. overall it was a great class!",,
oh my god! what can i say about him&#63; his class was in the morning and i am totally not a morning person but he totallyyy woke me up! Soooooo funnny he's unbelievable. there were 4 tests and he drops one. one paper which his T.A grades. u have to read the book from front to back and read ahead! he's awesome tho i love this guy! take him!!,,
"BEST PROFESSOR EVER! his lectures are SO funny you will WANT to go to his classes. I never missed his class. read your textbook, LISTEN to his lectures, no need to take notes because he talks fast, but he makes it clear. Tests are clear. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! =) *thumbs up*",,
"He is just everywhere in the class. He makes the subject interesting and fun. He tells stories, and makes the weirdest funkiest noises but it keeps you awake early in the morning with a good laugh. Go to his class because he goes over the things that you need to read in the book. Read ahead! overall, an awesome prof. I'd recommend him to anyone!",,
Full of energy. His lectures and the text almost go hand in hand. Make sure you dont miss class. he is good at clarifying concepts in the book,,
One of the most oddest professors you will have in your life. He creates an lively environment with his hyper personality. Clearly understands his material. It's easy if you pay attention and take notes. This is one of the must have professors at csun.,,
"Like the teacher but hate the class. It's one of those classes that all you do is take notes and take tests. You really have to read the book to know your stuff. If you are good at taking test then take him, but if your bad at it, I recommend you take another teacher.",,
My favorite professor. He's so funny and nice. he makes boring topics interesting. easy tests.,,
"One of the funniest people I've ever had the pleasure of encountering. I never took notes, but I read the book before tests. GO TO CLASS. He explains things very well, and he's friggin hilarious. I just went to hear stories about him and his girlfriend.",,
Mike is awesome. Can't say he's easy b/c you really have to know your stuff but he makes it fun to learn. His tests are single and group tests. You get the higher grade if you're within a 5 range deviation which helps a lot. Pay attention to his lecture and READ the book. You HAVE to do both. Study and you'll get an A.,,
Funniest most energetic Prof. at CSUN. Tests are alittle complicated need to read and comprehend concepts.,,
At 1st he's really cool cuz he talks fast and makes jokes but then it gets old and he rambles on and on. You have to sign in everyay and his tests are from book not so much about the lectures. Write down every detail about the paper cuz the T.A grades it and she's tough.,,
"one of csun's classic Worse Teacher EVER. Students beware. i faild his class and im a C student. I did his paper, showed up to class every time (and signed in that lame sign in sheet) Got D and Fail's on tests and got a Fail in the class. NICE GUY but huge ass after he grades ur test &quot;on a curve&quot; DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS TRUST ME!!!!!!!!!!!! =x",,
"Gardner is one of the best professors I've ever had. He truly loves teaching and it shows. His lectures are a lot of fun and often interesting. You look forward to his class, even though it starts at 8:00AM. Highly recommended. There's also a ludicrous, arbitrary paper graded solely on following picky formatting guidelines.",,
"not the most organized, but not entirely all over the place. Mike has his way of teaching a class, he's extremely talkative but also very knowledgeable! if u paid attention in class you would see he does too make sense! i always looked forward to his class, and attendance is important, so make sure you go.",,
"He talks EXTREMELY fast during lectures and it's difficult to interpret and take notes during class. Basically you must read the text book before attending lectures are you will NOT understand the lecture. Attendance is mandatory, and there is only 4 test. The only required homeowokk if you want a good grade is reading the text book.",,
"Mike is dope. Yeah, he's all over the place but what he has to say is interesting and informative so LISTEN! He'll teach you 50% of the test. The other 50% u get from the book. He has group tests & solo tests which help ALOT! Come to class & pay attention. PARTICIPATE also. He loves that & it doesnt hurt when ur between an A & B at grading time.",,
Professor Gardner is a great teacher. Taking his class was helpful in helping me understand human motivation. I do suggest to those who are interested in taking this class to read the book cuz the tests are based on it and the notes.,,
"TAKE NOTES!!!! No matter how fast you have to write or how disorganized his lectures are, take notes!! If you take notes and study them, youll get an A easy. His class is fun and interesting, but all over the place.",,
"He isn't the most organized guy.. but he is funny and nice. He keeps your attention, but to pass the class you must read the book. You basically teach yourself.. but you have to show up because attendance is taken. He's a nice guy.. just not the most organized teacher. You have to be really prepared to read yourself and teach yourself.",,
"Fun teacher! Don't miss class, don't miss test, take notes, and read the book! If not your'e not going to pass!",,
"Professor Gardner is a lot of fun. HOWEVER don't get distracted. People sometimes forget to take notes because of his engaging lectures. His class isn't terribly difficult. Just do what you're supposed to, and you'll do fine.",,
"Mr. Gardner is a very energetic professor and enjoys teaching also. The only problem is that he doesn't relate to his students as individuals. After I took two classes with him, he still didn't remember my name. He calls on people by saying stuff like, &quot;you in the back,&quot; or &quot;how about you in the orange shirt.&quot; Other than that, he's a great teacher.",,
"Dr. Gardner make statistics FUN, if you can believe that! It takes an amazing professor to make something as awful as Stats fun. He does expect you to know your stuff though, but it always willing to help if you are unsure of something. I highly recommend him.",,
"Gardner is one funny guy. You'll really enjoy coming to his class. Tests are ok, you just need to read the material to do well on them. The paper he gives only has to be 3 pgs, plus some notes, and it's fairly easy.",,
"He is a VERY HARD TEACHER...he is funny and kept me awake at 8 am mwf but he is very difficult to understand..the tests are very hard and he grades hard to...i have never almost fail a class until i took this one and since i have to take it again, I WILL NOT take it with him...",,
"He is very unorganized and acts like he doesn't care about the paper, but he does! Be sure to write enough journals. He is fun to watch, but the test are from the book, so his lectures are pointless. His test are hard if you don't read every detail and study!",,
"He is fun to watch and loves what he teaches, but his test are tricky and complicated, there is four test, and no cumulative finl.",,
"Gardner is very fun. He was passionate about what he was teaching, and that made me more interested in learning the material. He does talk VERY fast and it's hard to take notes, so you should read the material about a day ahead of time so you can fully understand what he is talking about. If psych is hard for you, take someone else cuz he goes fast",,
"Hey is a great professor. Jumps from one topic to another so you cannot really take notes, although he is willing to help if you need help. If you read what he assigns you to read you will do fine.",,
"Gardner is HILARIOUS!! he is a great teacher, tests are all multiple choice really easy, he is totally laid back.. i had a blast in his class.. dont need to buy the book, i got an A, just by lectures, attendance is important to him tho, so go to class ull have fun there anyway!",,
"good teacher, quick talking, but will recap anything not understood in detail to insure comprehension",,

"I am not taking the lass to have fun and laugh alot, I am here to learn the material becasue if I don't know, I won't in Graduate school.... Talking as fast as the speed of a light doesn't HELP.....",,
"The truth is that we are not in elementry school anymore and the fact that Gardner makes us feel good about the class is Good. However; when you take a &quot;science&quot; type of a class, you want the instructor to lecture in a way that will be follow-able. Talking super fast and throwing the material to people at 100 Miles per hour is goning to help......",,
He is fun and makes class interesting! Keeps me awake...very funny!,,
"He is very funny and nice, but his lecture is unorganized. He jumps one topic to another and never stops. He is against note-taking, but it takes more time to study with your textbook. I enjoy attending his class, but I have to read my textbook very carefully to clarify the lecture.",,
Very entertaining. 6 yrs later I still remember him as being one of the best teacher's I've had at the university.,,
very funny..,,
He makes it fun and keeps you entertained. Even if he sweats a lot.,,
Lots of fun... good stories.... lots of laughs...keeps the interest alive in his class!!,,

He was very funny but said the same jokes in each class,,
awesome teacher..the subject matter was a little difficult but he tries to help you the best he can. study and come to class and you can do great. i wish i would have taken the first test more seriously then i couldve gotten a better grade.excellent professor everyone should take atleast one of his courses,,
"He is very funny and interesting but when the test comes, the questions don't apply to the notes. You need to study the book not the notes. Overall a cool class",,
"Excellent professor, he is funny and keeps your interest. Only one thing, he talks very fast and it is hard to take notes, just read and you will be fine.",,
One of the best teachers in the world. I loved his class. I hope to take him again. He is straight to the point and does not complicate the subject he is teaching. He is so motivated and also the reason why I became a psy major.More teahcers should be like him. you would be a fool not to take him.,,
Coolest teacher ever! He is so easy and has a great passion for teaching this subject. He made the class funny and interesting. Tests are easy once you get the hang of the format.Got an easy A.,,
"AWESOME professor! he is a great inspiration, because of him, i still want to continue with psychology as my major! very motivated adn jittery guy. we make the subject interesting and fun, knows what he's talking about, recommend to everyone",,
"this professor is the most difficlt teacher i have ever had in my whole enteral life. he talks so fast in class, and you will not understand any thing he saying. his doesn't have any grading skill or teaching skill. you will be a fool to take him for a class. i will never tell anyone to take him for a class. [he his a very bad bad bad teacher].",,
COOL TEACHER...YOU CAN TELL THAT HE REALLY WANTS HIS STUDENTS TO LEARN!,,
"if you need to learn motivation, this is the right professor for the job. the lectures are all fun and games but the tests are challenging. a very animated teacher who will keep you awake even at 8am but hard to keep up with because he has 10 thoughts coming in at once. skips from one thought to another. really need to read the book.",,
"Coolest teacher ever, no final or midterm. His lectures are soooo interesting and fun. He really makes you understand and apply the info. If you read the book and take notes you will pass with an A no problem. Go to class on time everyday and you get extra credit and by doing the experiments that are manditory your grade is bumped up. GRT CLASS",,
"I totally slacked in his class and never went he's a real stickler about attendance and gives you 12 bonus points at the end of the semester. I should have done better, i would def. take him again. Just four tests that are multiple choice...no midterm, no final, no paper...go to class or at least sign in and read read read the book!!!!",,
"Funny guy and very smart but has some strange ideology issues. His review days are an absolute ridiculous joke because he literally stands in front of class, opens the book and goes page by page simply reading the subheadings and then closes the book and says goodbye. He seriously does this and gives no specifics. Funny but not easy.",,
This man is crazy which is the charm about this professor. He literally bounces off the walls during lectures. I had him for a 9am course and everyday he woke everyone up. This is how crazy and active he gets during class...his shirt is soaking wet and the end of class. Class is easy but you have to read to do well.,,
"i took this guy like 4 years ago and i STILL recommend him to everyone-very friendly personality, explains this in a funny and simple manner, could it get any better to have a teacher like this&#63; i wish he taught my bio classes!",,
No Comments,,
"Doesnt deserve Phd in Psychology, He doesn't even guide students on how to take his tests. The book and lectures are barely any help to the tests, which are based more on &quot;if&quot; situations. Very dissapointed.",,
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! HIS TESTS ARE REALLY UNCLEAR, U CAN STUDY THE BOOK ALL U WANT ( BECAUSE HE DOESNT GIVE GOOD LECTURES I KNOW MORE ABOUT HIS DEAD FIANCE THAN PSYCHOLOGY!!!) EVEN IF U READ THE BOOK, HE DOESNT GIVE STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTIONS AND DOES &quot;CRITICAL THINKING&quot; IN REALITY ITS BS! DO NOT TAKE HIm!!!!!!",,
very easy class. take it if u want an easy A. as long as u read ahead youll be ok. hes cool at first but then gets really annoying cuz he preaches his beliefs and doesnt let anyone disagree with him. he knows his stuff but he goes too fast and skips around from subject to subject. dont sit in the front unless u like being spit all over,,
Don't be fooled! He might ssem like a cool professor and you may enjoy his lectures but that will come to an end after you see the test score you get.Difficult class to study for because he goes too fast and most of the lecture has nothing to do with the tests.See how much you like him after the tst,,
He was ok... i felt he was very hard even after taking good notes and reading the book.. his grading scale is very weird.. class is interesting.. but after this i lost my interest in psych... hes pretty funny but i think he doesnt care much about his students. Oh yea be prepared for experiments.....,,
This Prof. is thee best. I took him 5 yrs ago.Yes believe it. My older sister took him and now my younger brother is in his class. Tillthis day I can not forget this prof bcuz he was very helpful. Cares about his students a lot. A must take prof.,,
Gardner is the best! He is able to teach the class in a really fun way. I love going to class when he is teaching it.,,
I LOVE GOING TO HIS CLASS. HE IS VERY FUNNY AND INTERESTING ESPECIALLY AT 9 IN THE MORNING. THIS GUY IS SUPER COOL AND HIS LECTURES ARE THE FUNNIEST EVER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TAKING HIS CLASS.,,
The funniest teacher,,
"&quot;if you studied the brain like i do, you wouldnt do drugs...&quot;",,
Best Prof ever. Shows great concern for his students. Always willing to help. He is also extremely funny making students look forward to attending class. Doesn't test you on anything he hasn't talked about. Take good notes in class and you'll get an A guaranteed.,,
"Was hillarious but a bit sweaty, wear some protective gear if you sit in the front. Will be a class you remember afer college. He would make the information relevant to everyday life. The quizes online for the books helped me a lot, and lectures entertaining, but the videos made me a bit sleepy.",,
"THIS CLASS RULES! If you want 1 hour of straight-standup comedy. Take his class. The readings are very easy and reasonable 50pages/week. I never read and I still got A's on the test. His class is so darn easy and so funny, EVERYONE should TAKE this class. I woulda took this class just for fun!",,
"He is awesome, even at 8 in the morning. Full of energy and a great guy to talk to after class. You learn a ton, but the tests aren't easy. Look for study questions from the internet site on the back of the book.",,
"he is the most entertaining teacher ever! he makes psych very interesting and worth learning. be sure to pay attention and take notes and read b/c there are 4 exams. if you get him for a small class, you get to take exams in a group. i was in a class of 150 students, so i was on my own on tests.",,
"GREAT teacher, loves what he does. very inspiring. funny. i highly recommend him.",,
"This man is the funniest, coolest, most entertaining, nicest, and most inspiring man I've ever had as a teacher. He loves what he does and I loved going to his class everytime; he brought the subject to life, and I'm going to miss his class a lot. Simply the best professor I've ever had.",,
HE IS GREAT PROFESSOR. HE CARE ABOUT ALL IF THE STUDENT IN CLASS.,,
"Enthusiastic about what he is teaching and absolutely one of the GREATEST teachers I have ever had!! He uses real-life examples to teach every single concept, and it works perfectly. I walk out of every class feeling enlightened. Tests are easy if you know the material. Read the book and show up.",,
"One of the best teachers at CSUN! He's very
  enthusiastic and funny! He makes you want to pay attention. Great class, fair tests, very interesting!!",,
Very upbeat class! It is really interesting. As long as you go to class and read you'll be fine.,,
"always sweating...he is so hyper that you can't even take notes or undrestand the lecture.If you don't read the book, you'll barely pass with a C. Fun and easy class, too. multiple choice test and stuff.only if he wasn't so hyper!!",,
Yes the prof.is energetic & fun but the class is a challenge. The test are difficult and if you arent a good note taker then your next best thing would be to understand what the book says. No matter what you have to study and really understand the materia,,
"Very fun, very funny man and he plays basketball",,
He was awesome!! I took him three years ago and he is still my favorite!! everytime i went to class it felt like i was attending an educational comic show..i loved it,,
really wants to have people actually learn and makes it as much fun as possible.,,
"Dont see why many people give him the thumbs up. Yes, he is &quot;very very&quot; funny and energetic but once those tests come its over. By him being a nice and funny guy doesnt mean its a good class. Its a difficult class and difficult to earn a decent",,
very funny,,
great teacher but hard tests.. u have to study in order to pass the tests... but he is definately an outgoing teacher,,
"Great, energenic, adament professor. He gives notes that coincide perfectly with the book. His tests are very tricky, but if you take great notes you'll do fine. The funniest teacher ever and I would recommend to anyone and everyone. Class is interesting",,
"very cool guy. if you have him early, dont worry, he will wake you up. his lectures are fun and useful. psy isnt my major, but this class was interesting.",,

He is by far the best professor I have ever had. He has so much energy and you can tell he loves his job. I wish every professor I had loved teaching as much as he does,,
"Best. Professor. Ever. I actually looked forward to coming to class at 8:00am, and it takes me 45 minutes to get to CSUN! Tons of energy and a great sense of humor. If only all professors were like him!",,
"Best Professor ever had at CSUN!!! He'll keep you awake and entertain! A very friendly guy, not strict at all. He's very hyper though but overall I wish I had him as a professor in all my classes. Gardner gets an A+!",,
"This is the coolest professor ever! It isn't an easy A, but there is no homeword, just reading! No midterm or final either. Big class, but one you won't fall asleep in!",,
"very enthusiastic, funny, enjoyable class experience, even at 8am.",,
He is funny makes the class enjoyable and actually motivates you to go to class. When it comes to his test they make you think and are kinda hard. Take his class he is very helpful and understanding. Trust me you will never have a professor like this one.,,
very funny teacher !!! He is the best. I loved going to his class. Enjoyed his teaching method. He is Recommended.,,
No Comments,,
Gardner: |The Freudian basher&quot; is a funny guy. He teaches and keeps you entertained at the same time. Even at 9am he's energized and sweating as usual. The videos he shows in class are entertaining as well. Expect to have a good time.,,
"I thought he was a great teacher. He had a lot of energy, and was always making us laugh and feel comfy and not bored at all. Just read the book and focus on the stuff the talks about, and you will pass your exams. He curves a lot too!",,
"Dr. Gardner is very passionate and energetic, which makes the class very interesting. He gives the best examples and there will be times that you will laugh uncontrollably. He talks really fast, but just write down the main concepts.",,
"This teacher is the best teacher on campus. If you get him as your teacher, you will definitely be satisfied. He is fun and exciting, the class will turn out to be your favorite class ever.",,
"Gardner is very entertaining and his class is easy. If you need one-on-one attention from your professor, then perhaps Gardner isn't the right professor for you because he is exteremely busy and rarely had time to really explain things except in class.",,
"Very passionate, more videos than you care to see. Tests are challenging, but there's a curve. Funny guy, no fallin asleep in this class. Very interesting class, fast paced, not impossible to get a decent grade,nearly impossible to get an A.",,
has a lot of energy and his examples in class do help make learning the subject easier.,,
"He is definately an energetic professor, but he's not that helpful when it comes to teaching.",,
very funny guy,,
"Seriously great. This guy is halarious, and on top of that, extremely lenient. His lectures are worth listening to even if you're not in the class!!!",,
I recommend taking his class especially for non Psych major and also if you do not have so much passion to study Psychology(yet)but have to take this class. You will enjoy listening his lecture whole semester without without being boring being in a class.,,
No Comments,,
full of energy. the funniest guy ever! makes class interesting. a must take professor! all based on notes!,,
Very entergetic. Tests are ok.,,
I am currently taking his course and you will never ever meet another instuctor who is more passionate about what he does. He is super hyper and really wants you to learn. Very entertaining!!!,,
Teaches other psych classes as well. I strongly recommend him.,,
"this fool is tight. he's real clear, and has a grip of energy.",,

Best class I ever took at CSUN! This professor is phenomenal!,,
Renzi is phenomenal. He's not your buddy and he's not some new professor looking to get good recs. He's your professor. Be a student and you will learn. Let your TAs prove why your 'outside insights' are wrong in recitation.,,
"He claims that this class is not philosophical, but I beg to differ. I've never taken a 'philosophy class' before. It has never been an interest, and that still hasn't changed. HOWEVER, I will not deny that I learned alot. It was a pretty good experience, even if it was my last choice for a Texts and Ideas class. Buy the books online! It's cheaper.",,
Lectures are horrible- repeat his opinions from them on any test/paper. He isn't receptive to outside insight from students. No feedback on graded work/exams. No handouts/grades posted online so you'll never feel confident in how you're doing in the course. GO TO RECITATION- your TA is your best friend if this guy is your professor.,,
"The course is not meant to be an easy A, plain and simple. There is no doubt the material is demanding, but you CAN do well by paying attention and looking to understand the texts. I've honestly learned more in this class than I ever expected. It's one of those where every grade is fought for and satisfying. If you want to coast, look elsewhere.",,
"The class was interesting, but also really difficult. Besides him being kind of arrogant, he only accepts his point of view. BUT the TAs and weight of assignments help. I got a C on the first midterm (8% of grade), a B on the second midterm (I think like 12%?), but did well on a few papers and ended with an A-. Not an impossible class!",,
"While I enjoyed much of the material covered in this course and loved the readings, this was a VERY DIFFICULT class. Yes, Renzi is arrogant but my frustrations stemmed from his overly particular grading style. You may learn a lot and have interesting theories, but if you dont regurgitate his lectures from class, your grade suffers. Not my style.",,
"Very hard class, one of the hardest I've taken at NYU. However, the content is interesting, and he is an engaging speaker so lectures are never boring. Take notes very carefully as the lecture is very detail-packed and everything in the lecture will be on the exam. One of the most challenging but fascinating classes I've ever taken",,
"Not much grade inflation ÛÓ he keeps it real. If that's not your thing, don't take him (there are other, easier 'Texts and Ideas' classes). Sometimes he's very sanctimonious, but he's passionate with a real point of view. I learned a lot from this class. From my experience, you have to do the readings to get a good grade.",,
"Professor is arrogant and insufferable, but the class is trivially easy. You barely even have to do the readings if you pay attention in recitation and maybe scribble occasional notes in lecture. I don't really get the complaints about the difficulty, as I didn't even read any of the books and still pulled an A-...",,
Lectures are well detailed. EXTREMELY difficult readings. A hard grader. isn't clear about what he wants from you. DO NOT TAKE THIS TEXTS AND IDEAS CLASS.,,
"So far, the worst professor I've ever taken at NYU. Both, his personality and teaching skills aren't the best for an educational place. One day, I listened to him saying to one of his TA's to grade essay and HW assignments hardly. I totally understand he wants us to learn, but a C- on a paper that was workshopped three times is just unfair. AVOID!",,
I would highly recommended especially if you're interested in philosophy. It is extremely hard but was the most rewarding required class I had to take freshman year. Renzi is tough but very reasonable he doesn't hand out As but the TAs usually have your back. The readings were hard but super interesting,,
Vincent Renzi was one of the biggest disappointments that I have had at NYU. Don't take him unless you want to tank your GPA.,,
"Brilliant guy, extremely knowledgeable and he knows that he knows more than you do about the subject. If you are active he will like you and then will help the course fit you. So far, my favorite professor at NYU",,
"Rude, unhelpful, full of himself. I do not recommend him.",,
"Renzi runs the MAP program (the required courses for CAS) so he takes his REQUIRED course very seriously. The course material, essay prompts and quizzes are very difficult to make sense of and he grades incredibly harshly. It's not what a required class should be, and he's a really rough dude. I once tried to shake his hand and he told me no.",,
"This class was a huge waste of my life but I was expecting that from Texts & Ideas. Just don't take this professor, he requires attendance and is really patronizing about it. Lectures are tedious. This class is not too difficult though, just three short essays and three exams, you don't really need to do the readings either.",,
"A great professor!! Only thing is the class is really hard! Especially for students like me, because my major is not Philosophy and I understand about it very little. BUT if I take it now again! I can rock the hell out of it! Because now I learned a lot from Dr Renzi and our TA.",,
"The Best. He is helpful if you actively seek help.No BS. He is as clear as possible given the philosophical[here, synonymous with 'challenging' and 'thought-provoking] nature of the texts with which you will deal. It will take you DECADES to thoroughly sort through Nietzsche and Plato, and even then you will still have questions unanswered.",,
"This class is very demanding. The TAs are great though. You can understand everything, be able to articulate it on paper and still only get a B sadly. Renzi often seems arrogant while lecturing and presents the material subjectively which completely disinterested me.",,
"DO NOT TAKE PROFESSOR RENZI'S CLASS. He is a very intelligent man, but he is 100% unwilling to give anyone an A for anything. You can read all the novels, come to all the lectures, go to all the office hours and still barely scrape a B. For a required class, this is flat-out ridiculous. Take another Texts and Ideas course. Please.",,
no.,,
"This class has made me never ever want to read a book again in my life. Like, ever.",,
"You people act as though ancient philosophy and college-level writing are supposed to be easy. You should know what the difference is between an intelligent, thought-provoking question and dumb 'logistical question' about a final exam. Heaven forbid someone asks you to think critically or independently!",,
"I took the Writing Intensive, but I never thought it was going to be so difficult. It is definitely one of the most challenging courses I've ever had to take. At first, it seems daunting, maybe impossible, but it gets a lot better. JUST MAKE SURE TO TAKE NOTES. I wrote down everything he said, and it made everything 1000x easier.",,
"I had him for Text and Ideas: Writing Intensive. He is very intelligent and if you pay attention in lecture the midterm is too hard. However, he comes across as arrogant and unapproachable. Someone asked a simple, logistical question about the final and he proceed to go off on a rant about how we weren't asking him any 'intelligent' questions.",,
"I took this linked with Writing the Essay, and I swear to God I've never worked so hard in my life. He's a great professor, he knows his materials, but he can be religiously offensive. The TA also grades HARSHLY. If you do not love writing and philosophy, you will STRUGGLE.",,
"He isn't that scary. He assigns a lot of reading, but you don't need read it all. His lectures are very thorough and he points out the main passages of the reading. You will need to work for a good grade, and he can be obnoxious sometimes, but I'd say take the class just for the experience. Or if you just get stuck with it, don't worry.",,
"While he does assign a LOT of tough reading, it it not necessary because Renzi talks in such detail about each reading assignment that it's like you read the whole book without actually having to read the book. He is really interesting and smart. The only problem are his exams. They are so hard so don't take this class if you cant write fast.",,
"His class is SO TOUGH!! There is so much reading, and so much work! It is definitely NOT worth it! He gives the hardest texts and ideas class out of any professor at NYU!",,
"Really knows his stuff and explains them with clarity, he makes you see the texts like never before. But his readings are crazy for non-philo majors. Take his class if you're genuinely interested in the subject, steer clear if you're looking for an A. I probably spent 40% of my total homework time on his MAP.",,
"I was waitlisted for his class during enrollment period, and as suggested by my advisor, I contacted him about this. Apparently I wasn't allowed to join his class because I missed the first week because I wasn't enrolled in it. When I asked if there was anything I could do to make up for it he asked me to travel back in time. Very funny, Renzi.",,
"Strong lectures, tough grading, don't think you can bs ur way through the class its not possible. if you enjoy the material youl have a nice time but either way you will work for your b or if you r very strong an a-",,
"Steer Clear! He is a great lecturer, but his grading policy sucks. I'm hoping I can pass with a pretty decent grade. This class is too labor intensive for a MAP class. If you don't like or have no interest in philosophy don't take. This class will definitely bring down your GPA. Also, one TA graded to leniently and the other too harshly. Meh!!",,
"It's true, you do more work than any other Texts and Ideas class (especially if doing linked), but, if you are interested at all in the material, it's worth it. His lectures are always engaging and depending on the text, powerful. Exams can be tough if you don't read/pay attention, and papers are graded critically (but they're short!). Worth it!!!!",,
Do not take any class he teaches. Words cannot describe...,,
"Renzi is a solid prof and doesn't mess around. Midterms,finals and essays will be good for those who read,and a nightmare for those who don't. I got an A- but I read everything and participated in recitations (which counts!!). Go to class every week-he gives pop quizzes (if people don't come,he lectures about how we don't appreciate our education).",,
"Renzi is a demanding professor. He expects a lot, there is extensive reading, and his lectures cover some difficult material. That being said, I feel he is an incredible professor. I enjoyed all his lectures and they always left me thinking. His short papers are doable and as long as you show a good or interesting thought process, you'll do fine.",,
"A tough professor especially on grading, but the lectures are worth it. This class helped me understand Nietzsche, Plato, Freud, Socrates, Kierkegaard, the Bible, and St. Augustine in a way I would never have on my own. He gives pop quizzes to check up on attendance, so make sure you attend every class.",,
Had to put in 10 hours a week just for this class and ended up with an A-. It's not impossible to get an A as previous users have mentioned. It's just EXTREMELY difficult. Take this class if you are interested in philosophy and looking to read good literature and attending interesting lectures. Workload is as intense as it can get freshman year.,,
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS, especially if you have no interest in philosophy. I have never struggled as much as I did in this class, the recitations are not helpful at all. Writing prompts for papers and exams are extremely complex and difficult to get a good grade on. He made lecture interesting, but I didn't feel he was very approachable or helpful.",,
"He was an amazing Professor. He was crystal clear about what he wanted. TA's are useless. D the midterm (my fault) and got B's on essays and on the final and got a B+ in the class. Not bad considering I'm majoring in Comp.Sci/Engineering. BTW, took the class Spring '11.",,
"Antiquity & 19th Century LINKED-- NO, JUST NO! It is a GPA killer and he is the most pompous man you will ever meet. He is hard and just wants to make your life miserable. Save your life and do not take his class!",,
DO NOT I SAID DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. YOU WILL PUT YOURSELF THROUGH HELL IF YOU TAKE THIS CLASS. I'd rather live in Antartica than ever take this class again. You have been warned!!,,
"He's incredibly smart and definitely knows his stuff, so go to all the lectures and listen intently. He has high expectations and is kind of a ****; he's also very full of himself. But at the end of the day, he's brilliant. You'll struggle hard for a B/B+, but definitely do-able. Anything in A range is practically impossible, though.",,
He is a very hard professor. You need to do all the ridiculously huge readings. He can be religiously offensive and intimidating. He is the agressive type. Lectures are interesting but boring at times. TA's are not very helpful at all.,,
"This class is hard and fast-paced, but Renzi knows what he's talking about & lectures are extremely interesting. The amount of reading is difficult to manage at times, good grades are hard to come by, & the midterm was one of the hardest tests I've had so far, but I feel like I'm actually learning in this course. Praying for a grade miracle though.",,
"Before taking this class i was intimidated by what others said. But he's really not mean he's just very passionate about this subject. I went to his office hours for help and he was really nice and actually helped me a lot. IF you take this class be sure to attend lectures bc all of the necessary info. is presented there, overall good class",,
"Conwest: Antiquity and 19th C.- Writing Intensive. This is very much a lecture type class and don't expect too much interaction with Renzi but his TA is very helpful. There's a lot of reading and most of it is interesting. Before the first assignment remember to ask the TA, very specifically, what they're looking for in the writing assignments.",,
Great,,
"Class requires you to constantly read difficult works that REALLY challenge even the most educated. He IS opinionated and slips in his own views, however, to a certain extent you can disagree as long as you have a coherent argument. The coursework is very difficult and if you are looking for an easy course, this is not it. You have been warned.",,
hes sooo smart... arrogant yes but his lectures are undeniably interesting,,
"I remember coming on Ratemyprofessor just before Spring registration, and the comment I saw said just don't do it. But by the time I got to register I was stuck with Renzi. And after a full semester of his egotistical, condescending &quot;teaching&quot; I repeat JUST DON'T DO IT!!",,
seriously should have listened to the guy 4 comments down when i checked this out.,,
He's arrogant and obsessed with himself. If you ask him a question he immediately attacks you. On the other hand you really never need to read or do homework other than a couple of papers. Your grade is essentially based on whether your TA is a strict grader or not.,,
"Renzi, as a person, is very interesting and is convincing with his presentation of the texts read. However, his enthralling attitude toward the texts leaves little to no room for interpretation or opinions. In short, this class is just not worth the time or energy.",,
"Professor Renzi himself is a very interesting man. I see why a lot of people have been calling him arrogant, but to me it seemed more like he played the devil's advocate. The thing with Renzi is that the TAs do all the grading and it's very hard to know what, exactly, they are looking for. This would be a great class if he had better TAs.",,
just don't do it,,
"(i took linked with writing the essay) the subject matter is boring, he know its all by heart which is impressive, but WHO CARES. he needs tp get over himself. My TA didn't speak english and actually gave me an F on a one page HW assignment! don't take his conwest class.",,
"I had a love/hate relationship w/ this man. Renzi is pompous, no doubt, but I think his class serves its purpose perfectly. I think it's a great introduction to philosophy. I enjoyed it, and I really did not feel intimidated at all. The grading is NOT hard, despite what previous posts say. I really didn't put in effort and I got a B in the course.",,
Very enthusiastic,,
No Comments,,
"Renzi's lectures are intriguing and clear, but it's his TA's who make this class abysmal. Not only do they not know what they're talking about in recitations, but they are entirely unhelpful and unfair graders. Instead of reinforcing the lecture's content, the TA's put forth their own confusing interpretations, and screw you over on the papers.",,
"He's a good professor, yes. But he's also entirely unfair and unyielding. I had mono the semester I took his class. All my other profs worked with me to catch up on missed work, etc. while I was sick, but Renzi failed me for attendance!! It didn't matter that I had mono and had doctor's notes. I had to withdraw or else he said he'd fail me.",,
"A ton of reading and work, but this guy is one of the most intelligent people I've ever met, ever. He's rude and arrogant, but he knows what he's talking about.",,
"UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU TAKE THIS CLASS WHEN LINKED WITH WRITING THE ESSAY. Just dont do it. He thinks he's the smartest professor in the world and his lectures are very annoying, but I was able to sparknote everything without reading the books.",,
"Professor Renzi is intimidating, yet not evil. His class makes you think a lot and is very influential. If you don't like to read, then forget it b/c this is not a spark notable class. The material is pretty dense, esp. Nietzsche. Renzi is a bit conceited, yet I guess he has a right to be b/c the man surely knows his stuff. He can certainly teach!",,
"Don't worry Renzi, I'm not one of your &quot;friends.&quot; Granted, he's incredibly intelligent and his knowledge of the classics is irrefutable, his class is still absurdly difficult. No amount of preparation could get me beyond the &quot;B&quot; level. I felt like most of my effort was in vain. Avoid this class at all costs. Seriously. You'll thank me later.",,
"I think Prof. Renzi is absolutely amazing. He may be arrogant, but i believe he has every right to be. He conducts his lectures wonderfully and he's even amusing at times. I really really like him. It's his TA's I would warn against. But definitely check hm out. He's phenomenal.",,

"Smart and very interesting, but kind of arrogant",,
"What an arrogant prick! Insulting and belittling. He teaches his class by intimidation, and he speaks nonsense - grand-sounding, ethereal nonsense that means nothing and serves no purpose, but impresses. I pity the kids who get drawn in by him. Avoid him.",,
Professor Renzi is sooooo smart. He's pretty intimidating but you'll learn a lot in his class. Plus...he's hot in an Ed Harris kind of way. two thumbs up. You'll learn a lot and he provides great scenery.,,
"Renzi is the man. His lectures are captivating and truly illuminate the work, author in question. My understanding of Nietzsche and Plato has been enhanced by him. Seems like someone who will write great philosphy signing off as Vincent Dionysus. Except he is a big Platonist. Being high helps in writing papers and getting best out of his lectures.",,
"I think the name Nietszche will forever make me quake in my boots. Renzi's not respectfulin his opinion, but cracks a good joke ever so often. I must credit him in fueling my passion for the truth among all the things he said. I haven't found a lot yet. Call him a genius because like Frued he gets lots of students to believe what he says w/o facts.",,
"do not take this class if you don't wanna be challenged. the &quot;preceptors&quot; aka ta's... are FORCED to dole out bad grades on papers. enough required reading to last a lifetime. though challenging, i must say that if you put in the effort, your mind will definitely grow and expand... just as renzi likes.",,
"Difficult material, a LOT of reading. But very interesting. Renzi is also a very smart guy. Take it if you want an interesting and challenging class.",,
"A lot of people say they don't like this class/teacher, but I really do. The lectures are sometimes hard to follow because the topics are so advances, but I understood them, I felt so inspired/enlightened/all that good stuff. Renzi expects a lot but he's a good teacher, speaks his mind, and is always available for office hours. I'd say go for it.",,
"Renzi, the man, is a pretty funny guy. Renzi, the professor, is scary as****. I took ConWest linked with Writing the essay: the biggest mistake of my NYU experience. Not only were his assignments extremely vague, the material was explained as if I was allready well aquainted with nietzschian polemic. Honestly, the class is not worth your time",,
"Renzi is a tough teacher, and is intimidating at times. The class is quite tough but Renzi just wants you to genuinely think hard and put real effort into the class. He's condescending during lectures but if you go into him during office hours he truly appreciates the fact that you're trying to understand the text and rewards you.",,
"Renzi's class is awesome. His lectures are really good and he's pretty funny, if you can understand what he's talking about. he challenges just about everything that any student says in class, especially if it is dumb. the books he teaches are really interesting and he knows a lot about them. he never teaches from notes--he knows everything",,
"He makes the class extremely and unnecessarily difficult. The grading is ridiculously low (i don't know a person who got A), the assignments-vague. His teaching sucks since no one can understand what he's saying. I don't know why people think he's smart when they can't get a word of his lecturing! Avoid him by any means!",,
complete jerk. a real loser of a professor. avoid.,,
"Renzi was scary the first couple of days. After that, he was just plain intimidating. But no real harm was ever done by him, he won't bite, he is just a great speaker. If you are struggling with philosophical questions, or if you at least consider the texts as more than just assignments Renzi will be there for you.",,
"Renzi knows what he's talking about, but he lets you know it. He's a very pompous & arrogant man. If you say something in class that's wrong or that he doesn't agree with he'll shoot you down in a very condescending way. But, his lectures are generally interesting. But I dont think that makes up for his pompousness.",,
"So many are duped by his &quot;intelligent&quot; manner. I don't get this. Since when did being scary make you seem intelligent&#63; Anyway, Renzi's lectures are utterly boring in spite of his sweaty armpits, &quot;cultured&quot; bloviating, and rude manner. Count the minutes away.... s..l..o..w..l..y ....",,
"Professor Renzi is an amazing teacher, his lectures are extremely interesting. He is slightly intimidating if you talk to him one on one, but his lectures are great and fun to experience. He's not condescending, he just knows so much about his study and is passionate about it. Prepare to read hard texts and be challenged.",,
A very mean-spirited man.,,
"Well, frankly, all the hype about Renzi being an **** really isn't unwarrented. He's an arrogant jerk, but, he's an intelligent arrogant jerk. The man's got a lot of knowledge to share, so if you can get over his attitude, then you'll learn a lot. However, there are easier professors for a con west class; its hard to even pull a B in this class.",,
"Renzi is a jerk. He is totally unhelpful (don't go to office hours - he seems to live to make you feel like a nitwit) and unbearably patronizing. From day one, he makes it explicitly clear that he is interested in no opinions, thoughts, or feelings that do emanate from out of his own mouth. A thoroughly miserable semester.",,
"Everybody gives Renzi crap about being 'pompous' and 'inaccessible'; while there is a certain air he carries, no doubt, Renzi will, at the core, challenge you immensely. You have to be pretty together during lecture to get all of what's going on, but he's a fabulous lecturer and he takes his job seriously in regard to his impact on students.",,
"Renzi is in love with himself. His lectures are very interesting and thought provoking. However, I realized after the fact, that his lecture notes follow Sparknotes, almost line for line. Curious...",,
"Dreadful instructor, a pompous idiot with wrinkled clothes and overactive armpits. Ridiculously dull, loves nothing more than the sound of his own voice, belittles everyone, completely inaccessible, horrible grading, intimidating, rude, and narrow-minded. What more is there to be said&#63;",,
"Renzi is a man who knows his stuff. Lecture is very interesting, even funny, at times. He's always open to take questions during lecture, and he doesn't &quot;baby&quot; anyone, so be prepared for a lot of reading and a good amount of work. He also sees right through crap, so be prepared for an invigorating discussion if you ask a question in class.",,
"Renzi is hard, but the class is worth it. He makes you rethink everything. My only problem with the class is the fact that he overly interprets all the readings; and only his veiw is &quot;correct.&quot;",,
"Tough class. A lot of tense reading. Amibigous grades. I never know what to even ask during lecture. Sometimes he throws in some funny and applicable commentary, but he'd be better off staying in the Greek or Classics department he speaks of so fondly.",,
No Comments,,
"Professor Renzi is smart, but he knows it. He doesn't understand that most students don't have a lot of knowledge in the class before taking it. The recitation teachers were pretty good and fair graders. Renzi graded our midterm awfully. For example 45 out of 64 possible points should be a C- (70%) but he made this a D. Don't take his class!",,
"Great teacher, the class was a lot of info to process, and Renzi is not in the business of babying anyone. However, his lectures were always so on point that I ended up mainly studying from my notes. The good thing is too that his stuff sticks, and he remembers you. He is one of the smartest and best teachers I'd ever had at NYU.",,
"The intelligence, the humor, the hotness... what can i say&#63; Renzi's class is extremely interesting and informative. One can learn a lot just by listening to him speak. This class demands a lot of reading and concentration. You can't bs anything,because Renzi seems to know everything. I definitely encourage all to take his conwest class.",,
"Renzi is tough, but really good at what he does.",,
"Renzi's a tough ****, no question about it, but he's also one of the most brilliant professors you can have...or at least it seems that way. He's arrogant and can do that thing where he's not really answering your question, only confusing you more, but if you put effort into the class, it's really rewarding.",,
Really heavy and dense reading. Clear and informative lectures. Very demanding class. Recommend doing the Writing the Essay link to save a recitation.,,
"He's arrogant, obnoxious, pretentious, sarcastic and too smart for his own good--I LOVED HIS CLASS. It was the only one I looked forward to/didn't doze off in. His midterm is hard, but the final is a gimme. It's easier than his pop quizzes.",,
"He knows so much that he's forgotten that his students don't all have the same background in philosophy. I wish I could've learned more, but I was too busy just trying to tie it all together to make it mean anything.",,
"Renzi is an awful professor, a rude, obnoxious, unhelpful, arrogant pig. Avoid him like the plague. He's too busy worshipping his own intelligence to be of any use outside of lecture time.",,
"he's condescending, arrogant, and mean just for the hell of it. all the same, i learned a lot in his class.",,
"Renzi is your typical arrogant professor. His class is only interesting because he is such a braniac. Miss a class, though - come to him with a problem, and he's sure to make you feel like an idiot. Be aware, also, that this class is NYU's official avenue for required anti-Christian rhetoric.",,
What an amazingly smart sexy bald man. He makes going to class almost as fun as shooting pool in local Brooklyn bar.,,
"I hated this class!! the material was so dense and difficult to get through. Lecture was extremely boring, but helpful in clarifying the material. Renzi is VERY intelligent and intimidating that it's hard to approach him.",,
"I absolutely hated this class! The material was interesting, but Renzi's ridiculously difficult grading policy and intimidating demeanor made me dread the class and every assignment. I completed 95% of the reading, but I never felt comfident or prepared. Also, major pit stains!",,
"Renzi's a pretty smart guy, but he's cheap and bald. Helluva dancer, graceful and swan-like. They ought to give him a better office. Maybe a corner unit with some mahogany panelling&#63; What's the deal with those damn fire drills&#63; Can't learn Philosophy while being herded out of the building.",,
"Renzi is incredibly smart and interesting, but he makes even his most intelligent students feel stupid sometimes. It's really hard to process what he wants from you, now matter how hard you work.",,
"Boring at times, but Renzi is a really smart guy and he has the ability to make his students understand the complexities of the texts he deals with. He is by no means an easy grader, but if you keep up somewhat with the reading you'll probably do alright.",,
"Extremely intelligent. Extremely stringent. Interesting treatment of course material undercut by attendance policy and length of reading assignments. A challenge, if you are into that sorta thing.",,
"the material was interesting, and so was the grading. you think you're doing great and then end up with something less than stellar. i think my TA tried a little too hard, but at the same time she couldn't even explain the paper topic.",,
"It's not impossible to get an A, I did. The material is icredibly interesting. It was my favorite class of both semesters i've been here, and I'm not even a clasics or philosophy major. Renzi is SO intelligent, and teaches well.",,
His class in INCREDIBLY interesting... but u won't get an A no matter how hard u bust your a$$. He is a great prof. and lecturer but verrrrrry difficult. Only take him if your ready for an immense challenge.,,
Professor Renzi is a scarily intelligent man who has an interestingly socratic way of intimidating the hell out of all the students in ConWest. He makes the class so incredibly difficult yet so incredibly interesting and engaging and mind-opening and fun,,
"mmmm renzi. definitely knows his stuff, definitely has a lot to teach. hot because he's so damn smart.",,
he's so smart it's scary. grading was definitely unfair. it's so interesting though it's a shame to not take it but you won't get an A,,
Hard as Hell... But overall a good learning experience.,,
"his class was very difficult as a MAP. i think he is an amazing professor, but has unfair grading policies, where you think you are doing well all semester, and then do horribly on the final grade.",,
No Comments,,
"he's way smart in his field, but way too hard on a map course",,
too much work for a MAP class,,
very mean and arrogant,,
"This class was awesome, you just had to really work for the grade.",,
No Comments,,
Very good professor. Teach economics not just based on textbook. Lectures are stimulating. Tests are not hard if you are willing to think. Would recommend.,,
I wouldn't take it again!,,
"Although I am not a Economics major, I enjoyed this class a lot. Harry was very clear at his explanations and would not mind to repeat unclear concepts. Honestly, I dislike his arrogant attitude. CLASS STRUCTURE: Final grade is NOT curved, so you better work hard for an A. This class is based on 3 exams for which each question is worth 1 point.",,
"Explains concepts clearly - but goes really slow. Useful for students who aren't used to economics concepts but unbearably boring to sit in lectures where he panders to students like we're kids. Grading system is ridiculous - one point one percent. Some questions on tests are vaguely framed, meant to trick you, and other answers often have merit.",,
"Kits isn't helpful at all. The tests aren't that hard, but you will NEED to study by the book. He barely covers any of the material in each chapter. Again, not that difficult, but you MUST STUDY BY THE BOOK.",,
"By far worst economics professor of all time. Test are not hard but his lectures are useless. scares people that the test is coming from the lectures but it did not happen once. Everything comes out of textbook. Arrogant and always complaining. In this way, he never builds any bonds with students. Doesnt try to listen to us. bet my life on my rate.",,
There were only three assignments for this class - three tests that add up to 100 points. These are incredibly easy if you read the book and attend (at least some) lectures. Professor is a cool dude and makes the lectures entertaining. Really good for an intro level course.,,
"Pretty decent class. Grading set-up is simple: every point you get wrong on the tests is a point off your average. Tests are heavily based on the textbook so if you read them closely you'll be okay, even if you miss class. The professor is entertaining and makes concepts clear and memorable. Accent was sometimes distracting, not unbearable though.",,
This guy is the hardest grader you will ever have for a class with essays in it. But his lectures are engaging and eye-opening. He takes economic ideas and applies them to comment on society and how (he believes) it should be fixed. Definitely one of the best classes I've taken here. But this is NOT an easy class. I barely passed.,,
"Prof Kitsikopoulus is funny, knows his stuff and most importantly is a great teacher. He conducts class in an engaging way, encourages participation and uses real world examples to explain the concepts. Tests are tough but you learn a lot. This was definitely one of my favorite classes because of Kitz",,
"Grade is derived from a total of 100 questions over 3 exams. Solid A is less than 6 wrong. Getting an A- is VERY easy, but getting an A is very tough. You must read the book (there are a couple fact based questions each test that are only found in book). The questions are designed to trick you, pay attention to wording. Great professor, engaging.",,
"Kitz is da man! He is extremely funny and explains subject material well using a great amount of detail and relatable examples, so go to class! Downside, he only has three exams that count for the whole class & they're super tricky! So, pay attention in class and make sure you get the book!!",,
awful,,
"super awesome prof, just be sure to read the textbook. talks about relevant current events which helps a lot",,
"Kitsikopoulos is a great professor & lecturer. He is very entertaining and tells funny jokes during class. He is also easy to approach with questions. The only thing is that grades a 100% based off exams, and the final exam was really difficult (average final exam score of fall 2013 was about 71%).",,
"Great guy, good at taking care of those kids who try to show off. His grading system is ridiculous and the material is hard. If you want to do well, read the textbook and go to lecture. If you can't bring yourself to do either, drop the course. Not worth the stress.",,
"He's a funny guy and a good professor, but his grading system is killer. You can only get 6 questions wrong throughout the semester to get an A (which I was one away from getting...)",,
"One of the easiest Econ classes at NYU. He is entertaining during lecture and I learned a lot. If you dislike this class or find it hard then its a good indication you shouldn't be an econ major. There were three exams and each one got more challenging, but overall the class was pretty easy.",,
"The materials are not that hard, but it is the way he chooses to grade that drops most people's grade. If you made one mistake on one of the exams, you lose one point on your final grade. I studied a lot and ended up with an A-, but I am pretty sure those who get As do not necessarily know much better than I do. I did enjoy his lectures though.",,
I was hestitant to take this class but his lectures were really clear and helpful. Its important to read the book but in class he emphasizes important parts you may have skimmed over when reading. Grading scale is awesome- 75 is a B. Pretty good prof overall,,
He is a terrible professor,,
Confusing and adds stupid questions into the exam such as history dates. But not too hard.,,
"Overall a really great professor. Thick accent, but once you get used to it he's pretty easy to understand. However, he basically just summarizes the textbook and gives examples I tend to just zone out. Take him if you're passionate about econ--I didn't care enough to handle this professor.",,
"This class was cake. A lot of people complain about it, but I went to 3 lectures the whole semester and got a 97%. The best part of the class is that there is ZERO homework. Just three tests with a total of 100 questions, each question 1% of your grade. This class took up maybe 25 hours of my semester in total. Definitely take it.",,
Useless lectures. Just read the book. Tests are tricky so study hard.,,
"Loved him, loved the class. Takes a while to get used to the accent, but he's a fantastic professor, engaging lectures. I didn't miss a single class even though it was at 8am, that's how amazing he was as a lecturer. Tricky questions on tests, but just be careful when studying. Probably the best prof I've had at NYU. Considering an Econ major now.",,
His lectures are useless because of his thick accent. Just read the textbook.,,
"great lectures, he is a really funny guy and explains everything really well. The tests are hard, even if you study the questions are worded in a confusing manner, but overall I recommend him!",,
"His tests are hard, but they're fair. If you read the textbook carefully and pay attention in lecture, you'll be able to do well on the exams. Getting an A is nearly unheard of, but an A- is definitely attainable is you work hard. People who say his tests are too hard just didn't try hard enough. I came out with an A-. It's doable.",,
"I think Kitsikopoulos gets a bad reputation but I like him. His lectures are clear (even though he has an accent), interesting and at times funny. The main problem is his grading policy. Three tests and that's it. If you do poorly on one one the tests, an A is almost impossible. I still recommend him as a professor if you can wake up at 8 am",,
He's a funny guy and knows how to keep you up at 8am. His tests are challenging and he likes to throw some curve balls in there to really make you think. He has some good jokes tho and his grading style could be improved.,,
"This guy is arrogant and rude with a bad temper. His tests are more or less just a collection of multiple choice riddles. Just out to trick you. Grading policy is bizarre. For example, if you get 7 questions wrong on the first exam, you have a 0% chance for an A for the class,after just 1/3 exams! Mostkids just get thrown into B/B- range.Just don't",,
"If you are GPA conscious, avoid taking this class. Your entire grade is based on 7 essays graded on a scale of 1 to 10 and it is IMPOSSIBLE to get an A. His grading of essays is more of an english class. Essay questions are very vague and you need to take notes on everything he says. Record lectures if possible and write everything down.",,
Kitsikopoulos doesn't care about the students. He's probably the worst teacher I've had at NYU. He doesn't make things clear (and I don't even mind the accent). His grading style does not promote learning. I love economics but his tests are ridiculous.,,
"I wonder why he use this grading and teaching: no homework,only test matters your grade(he didnt even give you a sample test!!!)and my rct is just as unhelpful as himself. I asked a question no the lecture and he didnt seem want to help me, besides he has terrible accent.",,
"Awesome guy! Captivating and really fun lectures. However, you really have to earn the A. It is attainable, but you must know the textbooks and concepts inside out. I highly suggest doing the readings. But besides that, he is always willing to help. He miraculously makes a 350 person lecture feel like an intimate 10 person classroom.",,
"He has an accent, but he is funny though. he tried to teach well, but he is not so familiar with the textbook, that's true. and he doesn't really follow any syllabus at all. plus, his tests are very unfair, it's impossible to get an A. 479 students, only 8 of them get an A.",,
"Okay. If you do not want an F, do not take this class. LOL. Bottom line - your tests are the only way to obtain a good grade. Attendence doesnt count. Participation doesn't count. There's no homework. Well -- at least for this semester. I suggest if you take it -- take it if there is homework as well. Boost your grade as much as possible!",,
"Lectures not mandatory, but youre a bum if you dont go b/c this guy makes econ interesting and is very funny. Grading is straightforward. Tests can me tricky but are very manageable. Need to know the book well. Focus on the definitions to do well on tests. Good class.",,
"His is a wonderful teacher. He keeps me awake in class even though its 8am. An A is attainable, although it could be hard. You need to READ the book, understand it well, and be careful on test questions. A- is very easy though, if you read the book. Enthusiastic Teacher! Go for it!",,
Loved him. Sometimes I see him around campus smoking or sipping a cup of coffee and I just think he's great. He's super funny and very dedicated to making sure his students understand the material. The rules for getting an A are totally straight-forward and it doesn't require too much effort to get there. He's pretty energetic & has a great accent.,,
"Kitsikopoulos is a great professor. He genuinely cares about his students and is very approachable. He requires his students to think and analyze the different economists. If you are willing to put in the effort to learn and attend every lecture, you will walk away with an A. It is one of the most rewarding classes I took at NYU.",,
Harry Kitsikopoulos is one of the worst professors I've had here at NYU. He is inconsiderate towards his students and uses a grading system that is out to haunt your gpa. On the final he said not to write on the test because &quot;people cheat&quot;...HOW CAN YOU NOT SHOW YOUR WORK ON AN ECON TEST&#63;!&#63; Are you kidding me&#63; Avoid this class at all costs...please,,
His explanations are clear. (some ppl might have difficulty in understanding his prounciation) However test is bit tricky. You need to be VERY careful or you won't get an A. A- is not that hard to get though,,
"It's easy to get an B as long as you read through text carefully enough. Going to class doesnt really make a huge difference... He might be a funny guy abut the accent is sometimes annoying, especially for int'l student like me, not easy to understand him sometimes",,
"This guy is awesome. He knows his economics, and he knows how to teach it in a way that unknowledgeable people can understand. He makes a lot of entertaining jokes about drugs and the like. His tests are tricky, but if you've paid attention and read, you'll do fine.",,
You can do well even without going to his classes. I only went to the first 2 lectures and then just went on exam days. Very convenient grading system (start out w/ 100 pts and then lose points by # of Q's you get wrong on exams and HW) I just read the book and studied alone and got an A. Take this class if you want an easy A!,,
this class was pretty interesting and i definitely learned a lot but the tests were somewhat tricky. a bit tough to get an A unless u do the readings thoroughly but pretty easy to get a B and attendance is not mandatory and doesnt help for tests,,
"I really didn't like this professor. You don't have to go to class; all the test questions come from the textbook. Too bad he told me they all came from the notes...He asks the most obscure questions too. Your TA helps, kinda. Prof is somewhat interesting though. However, his accent is kinda incomprehensible at times.",,
Ridiculously corny and sometimes funny. He will make you want to learn about Economics if you have even a remote interest in the subject. You might not like this class if you're a Republican...,,
"To the rater before me: why read/learn on your own when you could simply go to class and receive a more in-depth yet clear lesson&#63; A great professor who genuinely cares about his students (even if there are 300). He makes his political leanings apparent, so you understand where he's coming from as far as his economic opinions. A good intro course.",,
"Anyone who says this class is hard is an idiot. Harry K is a useless teacher, and going to class is useless as well, but if you do the reading and the assignments, you should get at least an easy B.",,
"Great lecturer. He explains things well & talks about relevant current events. My only complain would be his grading system. He makes you do online problem sets but does not &quot;give you&quot; any points for doing them, just lowers your grade if you get too many wrong. Tests are easy, but not very representative of the material gone over during class",,
"Pretty easy class. No need to attend lectures or recitations if you do the readings and graded assignments. I put only a little effort and did fairly well. The final can be a doozy because of the volume of material, but if you put a little extra effort you'll definitely get the A.",,
"Horrible class. It killed my GPA. The class is required for my major and I'll have to retake, but with a different professor. I went to every lecture, rct, did all the homework and readings and still couldn't do well. The tests are ridiculous and not what he says to study, so you're pretty much screwed. He's mean, unhelpful and hard to understand.",,
"I love this guy! He presents the material in a logical manner and makes it interesting and relevant to the world outside. He's funny, doesn't take himself too seriously, and tries to engage with the students, even when there are hundreds of students in the class!",,
"This class is the biggest waste of time ever. Mine, at least, is at 8 am.. which is ridiculously hard to stay awake for. The professor is funny at times.. he gets so excited about certain things. But sadly, it's not entertaining enough to keep me awake (or going to class all of the time. If you read the textbook, you'll be fine. The tests are easy.",,
i dont understand the hype...this man is horrible in every way...he doesn't know how to teach...he isn't funny...he's awful.AWFUL.AWFUL.AWFUL,,
"classes can sometimes be very entertaining but can be boring as hell too! most of the class is asleep anyway. weird grading policy, although it may help sometimes. tests are multiple choice but can sometimes be very confusing! while reading the textbook might help, he sometimes decide to focus on one topic for too many questions.",,
"friggin, hated, this class. i was an econ major, and after taking this class, i lost all my interest in it. im changing my major, because of this guy. probably the most ridiculous/inefficient grading system EVER INVENTED. studied my ass off for all the tests, ended up with a friggin B. pompous, condescending, unfriendly man. AVOID HIM",,
Very entertaining lecturer.,,
Terrible teacher!,,
"His tests are really easy. People complain because they don't come to class, and subsequently get screwed on a test. Really, all you need to do is spend a good weekend to study for the 3 tests. There's no homework in between.",,
"Worst prof I've ever had, avoid him at all costs!",,
"Terrible teacher who is extremely rude and discourages his students from learning by constantly calling them idiots, etc.I learned a lot in this class, but that is thanks only to the textbook, not the lectures.Furthermore, his tests are designed to trick you, as the questions are poorly phrased and often irrelevant to the material covered in class",,
"Very funny and entertaining prof. Teaches straight out of the textbook. Lectures are pretty clear although his accent is a little hard to understand sometimes. Grade bases on three test and occasional hw assignmensts. Tests arent bad, final is a little hard though. Overall I really liked him as a prof definitely recommend him.",,
"very funny guy, and the tests are straightforward and easy. read the textbook and dont show up late. theres only three tests and each one is at least 25% of your grade.",,
"Your grade is based only on 3 tests....the first 2 are easy but the final is quite hard....there is also hmk due once in a while but it only works against you...meaning that you do not gain points if you get them right, you only lose points for incorrect answers,he is a great lecturer though and u will learn alot!",,
"He's amusing in class. The grading scale is difficult, but not impossible. His test questions (which constitute 100% of the final grade) generally aim to trick the students, so double- and triple-checking answers is necessary. Reading the book is recommended, but his explanations give a good overview of the concepts. He does Q&A after class.",,
"OK. His grading system for this class is VERY DIFFICULT. there are 7 essays, and he expects IMPECCABLE papers. If he sees comma in the wrong place on your bibliography, then you are screwed. Besides that, I loved his class, and think he is probably one of the best professors NYU has.",,
"He focuses on trying to be funny a lot. His class is not helpful, and the test is very easy- you only have to read the book.",,
the best,,
"Funny prof that explains the concepts well even when digressing into stories. From time to time goes on rants (sometimes audience interactive!) about the current adm. but does so in an economically logical sense. Occasionally not,but overall still an enjoyable class and don't be late, he'll rip you to shreds. Tests ok if you read the book and study",,
"Honestly, avoid this prof because he spends more time entertaining the class than teaching the material. He never adequately prepared the class for tests, and the grading system was bogus (even though it helped me.) I stressed more over this class because I didn't know what to expect, and it was one that I took in high school.",,
"Great teacher, great class, and extremely funny however the grading scheme is a little tough (but not compared to some other teachers in the same section).",,
Professor never shuts up about Iraq and why Bush and his macroecon theory are ****. He does not spend enough time reinforcing the concepts provided in the book - he wastes his time trying to appeal to students rather than focus on the material. Never goes over problems like you'd see on the tests. Avoid for someone competent.,,
"Absolutely hilarious professor. Worth going to lecture even if you don't like Econ because he puts on a show. Likes to get students involved, makes subject matter more interesting and understandable. Study for tests, don't mess up homeworks and you should be okay. Not the easiest, but most worth-while class.",,
Outstanding professor! History of Economic Thought class was fascinating and intellectually challenging.,,
"Funny, interesting, eccentric professor. Very good at whipping out examples that make concepts much easier to understand. Do well on the first test though, because if you don't, you are pretty much in a hole for the rest of the semester.",,
"DO NOT take him for history of economic thought. If you do, make sure you write down every word he says and regurgitate it in your essays. Don't attempt to be creative or draw conclusions, as there is only one way to look at the material, which is his way. The most disapointing class i've taken at NYU.",,
Great guy. Study up for tests and dont screw up homeworks and you will be just fine. Grading system is a little different but really doesn't make that much of a difference. Interesting lectures and pretty funny,,
"talks with a thick accent. Curve brought my grade down and killed my gpa. no room for mistakes in the class. as said before, grading structure leaves no room for improvement.",,
Good professor. Will launch RPG at you if you walk in late..IM not even joking. But good interactive professor and keeps everything interesting. decent grading. very large class so just do slightly better and curve will bring you up.,,
"Talks to fast with an accent sometimes, funny, but a little hard to approach for questions after class. Tests are not curved but pretty hard.",,
"Great professor. At first it was hard to understand what he was saying since he carries a really thick greek accent, but you get used to it. very funny, and very easy going guy. Has a good sense of humor, and gets the class to crack up every once in a while. He knows what he is doing. watch out for aplia though.",,
The professor's grading system makes the course unnecessarily difficult. Points are deducted from your grade as the semester progresses. There is no room for improvement. Your grade just progressively drops. The material used is overly technical for an introductory course. Nothing is memorable. There is no theory and all equations. Boring.,,
Spends half of class-time or more railing on and on with his tiresome political agenda. Enough already... shut up!!!,,
he's the best... just watch out for aplia,,
"Really nice and funny professor. His grading seems a little ambiguous, but I still recommend him. He's not at all hard to understand if you pay attention, but you most likely will be because he'll call you out on it if he sees that you're not. Overall recommended.",,
"Simply amazing, I enjoyed and loved hi, u will too",,
"this class is fun, although i'm sleeping half the time. if you read the book then you'd be fine. everythings is clear. he digresses into funny stories very often. good class!",,
"His liberal bias can get annoying at times, but his teaching style is very interesting. He'll definetley keep you awake.",,
"Engages the attention of the class, very informative and well organized. Tri-cycle test schedule: first one is easy, second is very hard, third is ok. Well-worth taking Econ I with him.",,
"One of my favorite professors at NYU. Harry Kitsikopoulos is an outstanding teacher. I highly recommend him to anyone and everyone. If you are an Econ major, there is no reason not to take him.",,
"One of the best professors I've had at NYU! I managed to stay awake at 8am in his class -- he's really funny and interesting, and an amazing teacher. I really learned a lot.",,
"Nice because you don't really have to go to class to do well, just read the book. But also not a great teacher.",,
He's hilarious. If you show up to class and read the chapters you should be fine. Do the textbooks multiple choice tests online because he gets his test questions from the publisher. Recitations were NOT helpful...don't go to them if you keep up with the readings and class.,,
I managed to stay awake and show up on a fairly frequent basis in an 8 am class. Very funny. His accent is a bit hard to understand sometimes but he's the best professor I've had so far at NYU.,,
"Really funny and a good teacher. Class is easy and fun. I even stayed awake! ...well, most of the time... just read the few chapters the night before the exam and you will get an A. that simple.",,
"funny guy. makes fun of kids. Good if you know econ but need to take the class anyway. No homework, just 3 tests",,
"Awesome lecturer, never had to go to recitation, no homework. 5 stars",,
"funny, great to wake up to (at 8am). his tests are NOT that bad, much much easier than the AP exam from HS. if you go to lecture and read the book, you will be FINE for exams. they are not overly difficult. he makes it very easy to understand.",,
"Great teacher, but a little hard to understand. If you can keep on top of your work and the reading, you'll be great, but you're whole grade is just three tests. And make sure you go to class when he tells you to since there's 2 lectures that ARE NOT in the book and are not covered by the TA's!",,
"Just to the left of Karl Marx, and speaks his mind, so be warned. English is ok, but can be hard to understand. Also seems very rude and offputting at first, but once he knows you he kids around with you. Follows the textbook except for 2 lectures. Teaches material as is but doesn't add much to it.",,
"Good teacher. Horrible testing system, 3 multiple choice tests, but if you can handle it, take him",,
Hilarious guy; makes economics interesting and explains clearly. Tests are hard because there are only 3 (totally 100 points altogether) so study HARD. Always uses the example of selling pizzas and makes fun of students.Cool guy.,,
"He is very very funny! I love him. The course is horribly hard though. THREE TESTS. Meaning you screw up once, you are screwed. The first test however is always the easiest. The next two, omg, pray. Take him. Whats the alternative&#63; Liberman&#63; ugh...",,
solid,,
"He is funny, as well as to the point about the subjects. He won't leave you hanging or confused.",,
hilarious and friendly. makes fun of students like it ain't no thang.,,
"nice teacher, hard to understand. dont be late",,
"What are you guys talking about&#63; Kitsikopoulos is such a good prof. He cracked me up every single day, and his material was more understandable than Lieberman's book! The tests suck, study. He has a Greek accent but everyone can understand him perfect",,
"I can't understand his him with his accent, speaks too fast, speaks too low, and starts his lectures early, and ends them late. He's very pissy about the student getting up and going to the bathroom or comming in late (understandable). His tests are hard.",,
Course is STRAIGHT from the book. Love the grading (there's 3 big tests and they make up the entire grade). Never went to class and got a good grade. Just study and memorize.,,
"amazing lecturer, explains everything so well and makes the concepts easy, but the tests are HARD and grades on the class ride don't ride on much. very left-wing, makes econ a lot of fun.",,
"One of the toughest professors at NYU. He REALLY emphasizes applying concepts - understand the material and do every practice exam you can find, memorizing won't cut it. He's intimidating, but also an invaluable resource and an exceptional teacher. Orgo hurt my GPA, but I really do have a greater understanding of chemistry thanks to him.",,
"srsly, most brilliant prof I've had. majors or reg orgo, def take him. he's not easy at all and can be a v obnoxious figure during the year, but in the end you'll appreciate learning orgo from him specifically. do literally every question of his, textbook or prac exams, promise it's worth it. also see tom, he's basically psychic w exam q's.",,
"Dr. Jones is one of the greatest lecturers at NYU. Orgo I was an incredibly difficult course, and while the material covered in Orgo II is objectively harder, the smaller class size and access to practice problems made it much more fun! If you want to get the A in Orgo, attend every lecture + Tom's review, do practice problems and PAST EXAMS!",,
"I made the mistake of taking him for both Organic Chemistry I and II. If you can avoid, do not hesitate. The material he teaches is irrelevant to tests. Instead, you have to analyze concepts through problems yourself",,
"Jones is incredibly difficult. He will push you harder than you've ever been pushed. You HAVE to work hard, and you HAVE to study. But he gives you a truly deep understanding of the subject and you will walk out of this class proud of your grade.",,
"The class is difficult, no doubt. But he is the best of the best. know one knows their stuff like prof Jones.",,
"No partial credit. Strict grading criteria. Tests are based on picking up patterns from problems, not lectures. Regardless lectures are presented sloppily. Doesn't care. Avoid",,
Complicates things,,
if you do not want to study 10 hours a day to pass then don't take his class,,
do not take him! No partial credit on test questions; either you get it or not.,,
"Jones' exams have made me shout for joy and cry in defeat. Kahr goes much slower, and from looking at their exams, makes much fairer exams with questions that come straight from the textbook. Jones tests for critical thinking under pressure, while Kahr straight up tests for work ethic. If you work hard, save yourself the headache and take Kahr.",,
"I'm not going to lie - Organic Chemistry I was very difficult. However, Dr. Jones is a great lecturer and knows his stuff! I HIGHLY suggest not skipping lecture - things can get confusing fast. Make sure to go to Tom's reviews and do practice problems. The grading scheme is pretty rigid - so don't bet on a high grade because of a low average.",,
"Lectures aren't clear and tests are designed for you to do bad. Also, the grading criteria is rigid, so the grade distribution is not taken into account. Nothing will save you unless the math to calculate your grade ends up right for you",,
"I have just recently taken the class, fall 2016. No matter how smart you think you are or how well you can take a challenge do not take this professor unless you wish to destroy your GPA. In my class the average on every exam was a 55% and a 38% on the final. Be smart stay away your medical aspirations depend on it.",,
"He really tries to help you learn the material but the difficulty of the course comes from his grading methods. The test averages are so low because he doesn't really give partial credit -- it's either right or it's wrong. Go to the lectures, do past exams, do homework problems, and keep up with the reading.",,
"Test averages are around mid 50s. The tests however are easy if you read textbook in advance to lectures, do all of his group problems, do Kwok's problems, and do textbook problems. I have a 90 average on his tests. See the difference? If you work, you get what you want. If you're a lazy scrub, then get a reality check.",,
Organic Chemistry is hard no matter where you take it. You HAVE TO work hard to get a decent grade for this class. Read the textbook before each lecture. I would also recommend not to take any other science course while you are taking this course. His tests are hard. Do the old Princeton exams as well as the sample exams that he posts.,,
Majors orgo wasn't too bad. Most of the learning takes place during the group problems with the TAs. The lectures are pretty tough to understand but reading ahead definitely helps,,
"Jones is brilliant + made orgo 2 my favorite subject by far. Do all of Tom's homeworks, review sheets, group problems, practice exams, go to review sessions, and do yourself a favor and go to lecture (even if it's 8 am). If you're coming from another orgo 1 prof, you're gonna have to work twice as hard. If you still fail, then don't blame Jones.",,
"Everyone who says that Jones cares about his students must be in his majors class. no signs of caring in his regular Orgo class. He teaches as if you already know the information, which for a majority of the class isn't true. Presents the information in a very confusing way. It is unnecessarily hard and he's just plain rude. Terrible class.",,
"Professor Jones was, by far, the best teacher I have ever had at NYU. He genuinely cares about every student and wants you to do well. Organic Chemistry has a notorious reputation but Jones really forces you to UNDERSTAND the material if you want to do well in his class.",,
"Has tons of interesting stories and is actually very friendly. Cares a lot about the subject and about his students, but does grade strictly. Takes a lot of work to do well in his class but his exams are always reasonable.",,
"Jone's is a brilliant chemist, but honestly wayyyy overqualified to be teaching intro orgo. If you want to do well in this class there is only one way, and that is to do ALL OF HIS PRACTICE PROBLEMS. The textbook, which he wrote, is helpful for nailing down details, but his exam questions are nothing like the book. Put in the effort or die.",,
"Brilliant mind, horrible person. Do all of his book problems, old exams (including Princeton) to even have a chance at passing. Attendance not mandatory, but you skip a class, you fall behind.",,
"Orgo is supposed to be hard. I think at NYU we are fortunate to have one of the most knowledgable people in the field. If you read the textbook, do the practice tests, and do Tom's HW, you can at least get a B. If you understand what you are doing in each problem and why you are doing it, you should be able to get an A.",,
"Jones is a genius. He can explain things really clearly and you learn a lot in his lectures. That being said, his tests are extremely difficult. First semester I had Karr and did about 1/10 of the amount of work compared to second semester with Jones... first semester I passed, second semester I failed. You have to do a lot of work to do decently.",,
"MJ can be bit intimidating at times, but the problems that he gives out are extremely eye-opening. Organic chemistry is not too bad if you don't fall behind and engage. JOIN MAJORS ORGO. It will help you tremendously and forces you not to fall behind. Tests are difficult and grading is tough, but it's a fair class.",,
"Read the textbook and actually try to understand. HARD AF class, but you'll get the hang of it eventually. Test average is very low (High 40s to Mid 50s), and the class curved to B- so even though you suck at it just feel good knowing you have at least a B- .",,
"As an average student, I took orgo as a game and just wanted to beat Jones. Do every possible practice exam question you can find (notorious for putting old questions on exams) and be sure to do the group problems even if you aren't in majors. Go to the ARC! Hardest class I have taken (made me cry often) but that made the A so much more rewarding.",,
Test averages are below 50's. He gets very frustrated with his NYU students. He's very humble for the genius that he is... He wrote his own textbook.. so study it religiously. If you're taking him at NYU. FIND HIS PRINCETON EXAMS AND DO ALL OF THEM. i CAN NOT STRESS THAT ENOUGH.,,
"Avoid. Half the class received C. Great lectures but tests are v. difficult; it's impossible to do all 10,000 provided practice q's that can pop up on them. Class test av. was 50. I had an A- with Mahal (she's great), did 2x the work for Jones and still did much worse. It's very hard to gauge if you understand material from the way he tests you.",,
"Be prepared to read the textbook, attend every class and review sessions, and study on a regular basis. The hardest class with the hardest professor I've taken at NYU so far. This class is manageable, but you really need to get your head in the game before the semester begins.",,
"Please i beg you all do not take him as a professor. I had a great GPA first semester when I took Orgo 1 and MJ ruined that. He is one of the rudest people I have ever met and does not care about you unless you are in his Majors class. Made a hard subject even harder. There goes med school for so many hard-working, smart people. Hope he retires.",,
"Maitland Jones can seem intimidating and quite difficult, but he made the subject of organic chemistry more interesting than ever. Sure, his tests are tough, but they allow you to think outside the box, make connections, and understand the art of organic chemistry. Would take again.",,
"Insanely brilliant, funny and engaging professor. Insanely difficult exams. At the very least, he makes orgo an extremely interesting subject. If you are forced to take orgo, you might as well at least *try* to enjoy the journey. You MUST GO TO LECTURE, KEEP UP WITH MATERIAL, AND DO EVERY SINGLE GROUP PROBLEMPRACTICE TEST YOU CAN GET.",,
"Orgo is hard on its own but Jones' tests are ridiculous. Avoid taking him at all costs. Did the group problems, past exams, Princeton exams and attended all lectures and his exams were still extremely hard. He is also intimidating and non approachable.",,
Tests are very difficult and is not based on what is taught. The exam questions require you to think outside the box. The professor is brilliant but is unable to relate to students who struggle to grasp the material.,,
"It's organic chemistry, what do you expect. It's is hard no matter what, but Maitland and his textbook are there to make your life easier by presenting the information in a clear manner with plenty of examples and practice problems to help you work through the course. This course requires a lot of reading and studying, but again, it's organic chem.",,
Just no. A difficult course made even more impossible by his inability to relate to students who have a hard time with the class. If you don't do well on an exam he assumes it's because you're lazy and don't put in the work regardless of the fact that organic chem is a notoriously difficult subject.,,
"A bit intimidating to approach, but he is actually very nice and helpful. Of course, his genius-level intelligence doesn't quite always translate to understanding by us lowly students, but his textbook (written himself, pretty much a denser form of his lectures) is very helpful and I learned a lot from him. Not easy, but worth it to take from him.",,
"Jones will really push you to study to your limits and that is the only way to do well in this course. Study study study, solve as many problems as you can and don't panic! This course is doable if you put in the work. Jones is beyond intelligent and he only hopes for his students to learn and do well.",,
Worst professor ever.,,
"Absolutely amazing. Jones is a genius. Yes, his class is hard, but do the group problems and you'll do well on the exams. Will give you an above and beyond understanding of orgo.",,
"Extremely tough and generally apathetic to whether his students actually pass or not, but you're going to have an incredible understanding of organic chemistry coming out of his class, and in person he is pretty approachable. Do as many of his problems as you can and you should be more prepared for his tests.",,
Jones is effective at teaching orgo. He's knowledgable and has come up with a good structure for the class (especially if you're in the majors section). My main complaint about him is that he can be so unapproachable and he has very little compassion for students that are having a hard time. He's the last person I'd go to for help.,,
"Absolutely the best professor I have had at NYU. Amazing professor and very knowledgable. His textbook is extremely helpful since he bases his lectures on it. Also do his problem sets, they are pretty fun if you like organic chemistry.",,
"Orgo is intrinsically a difficult course, but Jones did a good job explaining the harder concepts. Of course it took a lot of time to understand, but I learned a lot. To those complaining about the difficulty of his lectures and exams, isn't that what you expected? Don't complain about something that was told to you from the start.",,
"By far the hardest class I've ever taken, but also the one in which I learned the most. Jones is brilliant, but sometimes to the point where he just couldn't understand why we didn't get it. Do every problem he has written that you can get your hands on and you'll be fine, though I'll admit to having nightmares about the tests.",,
"the lecture is just him talking to himself and solving problems by himself with no concern for the fact that no one knows what the heck is going on. exams have nothing to do with what you learn in class and are impossible! hated this class, avoid at all costs",,
"After taking Orgo1 with Jones & lecture, and then taking orgo2 with Jones in Majors, the experience was completely different. Didn't appreciate him for orgo 1, but getting to know him more personally in orgo 2 made me realize his genius and skill in teaching. He made orgo memorable and enjoyable.",,
"Loved this class, Jones is an excellent teacher in explaining an intrinsically difficult subject. He focuses on the concepts and not the memorization of reactions. The grade you get corresponds to the work you put in. Do as many practice problems as possible.",,
"Professor Jones is often incomprehensible during lecture. The only time he is truly audible is when he yells at students for something that sparked his temper, which can be anything. Tests on material often outside the level of difficulty presented in the homework and class. I did well because of the hours I put in, not because of him.",,
Orgo is a hard class and Id rather take Jones anyday. He focuses on the how and why and doesnt just expect you to memorize. If you do the group problems and the practice exams theres no reason to not do well in his class. Going to lecture is EXTREMELY helpful because he spells out the subtleties step by step. Overall a great professor.,,
"Prior to this class, I have heard that Professor Jones was rude, quick-tempered, and impatient. All of these rumors have been proven true. I will admit that his textbook is decent, but, his ability to lecture is poor.",,
Loved this class. Prof. Jones is a great professor.,,
"Yes, this class is tough. But so what? Education is about learning and not getting the grade. if you are a scholar you would appreciate the class and will be a suitable candidate for medicine. Prof Jones is brilliant and the class is incredibly rewarding - curve always saves you at the end. Take orgo with Jones and no other professors. You're lucky",,
"At first, I was also very upset and thought this class was impossible. To do well, you have to figure out how to approach the questions on the exam. Once you do, you will get grades that show for it. Read nonstop and do all the questions from princeton and book & look for patterns. I did that and got above an 80 on every exam the second semester.",,
"This class is really challenging. You don't have to go to lecture, but you do have to go to Rec because there is a quiz every week. Four exams in total. If you can avoid Jones, DO IT.",,
"Everybody claims MJ is mean and uncaring but he is a teacher who wants you to understand the subject, not just know how to solve problems through repetition. That's why his tests are made up of questions you've never seen anywhere else before. It truly is a class where you get a grade that correlates to how much work you put in.",,
"Now read this carefully. If you have a very good gpa and a very very good understand of orgo do it and you might pass. If not, DON'T DO IT. This course is way beyond what you need to know at this level. Impressive but so what. Med school won't care i promise",,
"Ok, here are the stats for last year. Fall '10, there were ~600 students; by Spring '11, there were around ~300. Tests' averages went from 60 to 40 to 30. Honestly, this class was a true terror for me. I had never studied as hard as I did for this class and still, I BARELY passed. I BEG YOU, AVOID HIM! There are other Orgo professors at NYU now.",,
"He's clearly more interested in weeding out premeds than actually imparting knowledge. Way to go, Prof. Avoid at all costs.",,
"He's great at some things (like caring for the subject, and wanted you to MASTER it), but fails at others. Lectures&#63; Waste of time, book is LITERALLY him talking, anecdotes and all. Exams&#63; Final had a question in which a student emailed him about one of the group problems we did, and he wanted the rest of us to see her logic. Unfair, I think so.",,
"Very easy class just make sure u take an additional hard class with this otherwise like myself u will find urself with a lot of free time. How to get an A. Go to class, read the book, spend a week straight studying for exams, do every problem in the book and exams=A guaranteed!!",,
"brilliant man, terrible professor. does not know how to give an exam. our orgo I final had a diels alder reaction- you know that things from ORGO TWO! averages on the exams are around 40s and 50s. It sucks",,
"His exams are quite difficult, but I found if you do all the problems he assigns (including textbook & group problems) you should do fine. Use of the textbook is mandatory, I truly believe that this is the reason I did well. Lectures not really necessary, though they helped me. Really have to work hard to get a good grade.",,
"I don't know who you &quot;self-proclaimed Orgo geniuses&quot; are kidding. Jones is an absolute terror. I consider myself to be very apt at the subject, and still have these views. He has no interest in students learning, and instead enjoys making up ridiculous exams that confuse rather than awe. BEWARE.",,
"&quot;Quiet frankly&quot; - gotta love the self-proclaimed orgo geniuses. By the way, the class isn't curved (a lot of people failed 101), so the &quot;dumb people&quot; don't make it any easier for you orgo geniuses. Jones can't be held responsible for the fact that his A students are incapable of reasoning, but be aware that the usual smarts will not get you an A.",,
"MJ is seriously the best. If you have any common sense you will do fine in this class. Read his textbook and know his textbook, I mean he wrote it so it's clearly important. Practice exams, do tons of problems (understand them most importantly), and you seriously will be fine. Hard&#63; No. Intellectually challenging&#63; Sure.",,
"Quiet frankly the easiest class I have taken at NYU as a chemistry major. Jones is so loving and caring for his students and provides maximal preparation for exams, which I think because of the dumb people I didn't need to even study for them.Easy A if you have a little common sense. Spent most of my time studying linear algebra in his class!",,
"This is the worst class you could ever subject yourself to. I got an A, and I'm still saying this. Lectures are nothing but Jones going on random tangents, and he has no office hours to go over what he has &quot;taught&quot;. The TAs barely speak English. You must teach yourself. Keep up with the reading, do sample exams and problems. Still very difficult",,
"Im a trad student and this class is not impossible in any way. This is a very hard class but if you do all the suggested problems, old tests, etc. you will be more than fine. If you put in the time you won't get 30s and 40s on the exams. This class is meant to be a weed out class. If you want it enough youll do well.",,
"hehehe because of Jones, I had the experience of studying (really) the hardest in my life. :)",,
"Definition of a weed-out class. Jones is very intelligent, but very arrogant, and does not help students. He holds &quot;question sessions&quot; instead of office hours, and I personally have had an orgo class (recitation/lab) during every single one of them. TA's just tell you to read the book if you have a question and have no interest in teaching.",,
"non trad is the only way to get slightly around jones's incomprehensible babbling. his exams are terrible, and he tries to trick you at every turn. he doesn't care about his students or helping them learn. lectures are basically the textbook (because he IS the textbook). boring old man whose teaching style is talking to himself.",,
All I did was study and still got 30s and 40s on every exam. I knew the information on quizzes but his exams were not fair at all.,,
"I've never studied harder for a class in my life. Lecture is a waste of time as he has the textbook memorized (because he wrote it, of course). He refuses to meet with you to help you or to even talk to you after class! Exams reflect none of the material &quot;taught&quot; in class...specifically our final...Diels Alder reaction on Orgo I final&#63; Nice.",,
"Even if I had done well in the class, I wouldn't say he's any good. Getting a 30 on the final after straight 10s in quizzes shows MJ does not reward intelligence or hard work.",,
"He is the WORST professor you could ever get. His teaching is horrible, he makes absolutely no sense. His book is pages of crap bounded together. You study your butt off and still end up getting a 30 on a test. He doesn't believe in meeting with you, so don't bother. You think he's a nice guy in the beginning, but it's not true. DON'T TAKE HIM",,
"He goes down as one of the worst professors I've ever had. You have NO idea what to study for on exams. His textbook is more useless than a map without names. I would suggest getting Organic chemistry by Bruice; it's far more clear and actually gives you mechanisms, not bull!! Lecture is completely worthless. Good luck if you're stuck with him.",,
"Professor Jones' class was the best one I took in college. He is an asset to the university. If you have to take organic chemistry, don't miss out by taking another professor.",,
Really easy. Studied the night before the exam and got +20 pts higher than average always. his lecture is pretty much useless. Just go over the book and do problems,,
He is a terrible teacher. He goes on many tangents and does not really explain thing very well. Textbook is useless...he doesn't really follow it. TAs in recitation are not very good. Don't take him(especially not in Non-Trad). Ridiculous that I have to self-tech myself. Had to buy another textbook to study. Got a B after using different textbook.,,
This is a totally unbiased comment since I have not taken a test in this class yet. I want to comment that Jones is not clear about what is on the test until 500 students demand an answer. Read everything even if he does not cover it because apparently it is on the test. Basically paying 50k to teach myself organic chemistry.,,
"The most inflexible man on earth. You could have a death of someone close to you and he still wont give a crap. You could have mental health issues and he would not care. He'll just fail you anyway with no way around it, even if you needed to pass to graduate. One day, I am sure, when things go rough on him and he gets no help, ill say KARMA!",,
"Even though I love his textbook, he is a hard grader and didn't curve at ALL even though the average was really, really low. The TAs are the worst of the TAs that I have ever met. Beware of the TA with the TK initials because she doesn't give any partial credits! I had to get my exams regraded because of her and thankfully got my points.",,
"Worst professor ever. He is arrogant to the boot, although warranted he refuses to teach students. NYU students can't do anything since he's the only teacher, but if you ask him questions about something at times he might outright refuse you. Worst teacher in the history of my college career.",,
Very knowledgeable and passionate about orgo. I love his lectures. (I'm in non-trad.) They're clear and he helps you understand the concepts but you have to study hard too. Lecture is definitely not enough. You can't be lazy in this class and are expected to keep up. His exams are very difficult but fair game. 85 is A. Average is ~60-75.,,
"Please please please don't be scared of this class (non-traditional, especially). Jones is an *excellent* lecturer and a great teacher. Is very friendly and helpful in one-on-one interactions (at least to non-trad students) and tests are relatively easy after doing group problems (grades are heavily curved). VERY passionate about chemistry. TAKE!",,
"Jones is an effective and clear lecturer, but it's hard to get individual help in the course, because he's too busy (doesn't have office hours) and the TA's don't speak English. I've been in NYC my whole life and expect difficulties communicating with taxi drivers and store owners, but it shouldn't have to be that way with my teachers.",,
"Funny, engaging professor. The class has hundreds of people but he makes it interesting. He cracks jokes, and the textbook (which he wrote) is also very clear and funny.",,
"You will do exam level problems 2/3 days a week, get lectured once a day, and still &quot;fail&quot; the exams. Exams test you on how to draw wrong mechanisms, and TAs are very arbitrary when it comes to partial credit. You can do every single group problem four times, read the textbook, know how to do every synthesis and get a 40 on the final. Awesome.",,
"TA's are useless and cannot speak English to save their lives (I am an immigrant,and so generally more tolerant in this regard, but I cannot condone hiring TA's this bad). Robert Spencer suspiciously &quot;predicts&quot; all the questions on the test. Textbook is useless and full of corny jokes. Prof only cares about Non-trad/Honors sections. NO OFFICE HOURS",,
Two words: Robert Spencer.,,
"Jones is pretty much his textbook. Lectures are unnecessarily confusing, TA's can't speak english, so the only help you'll truly get is from reading and doing practice problems over and over.",,
"Jone's textbook is probably one of the most confusing organic chemistry texts to read and follow. You get much more out of reading Paula Bruice or Wade, and then go back to Jones. He does follow the sequence in the text though. Lecture room crammed. Hard to see writing on board. Otherwise a good lecturer. My TA cannot respond to &#63;s in english",,
"LOVE HIM. The class is challenging, but a lot of students make it harder than it actually is. MJ asks a lot of his students, but he's clear about what he expects, and he's engaging, wickedly funny, bombastic, and surprisingly sprightly for his age. Read the book, do the problems he suggests, take LOTS of notes in lecture--you'll actually learn!",,
Professor Jones is a very good professor. He is famous in the world or chemistry but he doesn't let that feed his ego. His pace is a little quick but keeping up with the book definitely helps.,,
"Yes, Jones is a brilliant amazing genius and all that... great... but when he lectures he goes off on tangents of whatever planet he's on and its hard to follow. Orgo 1 was very manageable, but during orgo 2 he went nuts. I can't say the tests werent fair but the grading is AWFUL!!! U never know what theyre looking for!!!!! TAs are awful as well",,
"Many people hate Jones, but its because they don't study. You HAVE to read his textbook and you HAVE to go to class. Memorize every problem in the back of each chapter. Jones is an awesome professor and a really cool guy... you just have to stop expecting to know stuff without actually studying it.",,
His tests aren't hard if you study. He is intimidating but is very helpful.,,
"exams are written to discourage as many as possible. Prof. holds no office hours, surprising considering orgo may be just the hardest undergraduate introductory course that exists. Book is written for graduate students going for their phd",,
"jones knows his stuff and the course is good overall but make sure you get a decent TA and go to reviews if they are held. i found them more clear than lectures. also, do all the practice questions in the book.",,
"He's a cool guy but his book can be completely ridiculous and has way too many side notes. In class he's funny but it's hard to contact him outside of class for help because he never seems to respond to e-mails. It's nice because he loves organic chemistry and clearly wants to help you, but he needs to be more available to students.",,
"Jones is respected for his research not teaching. Thus his way of teaching can be a little trifling. However, the subject itself is beautiful and worth waking up at 6am for. Organic Chemistry's reputation is marred by the influx of incoming pre-med students who fail to appreciate the spellbinding concepts. Be open-minded and it will be easy.",,
"MJ is an amazing professor. he really got me interested in organic chemistry. his exams are challenging, but you know exactly what to expect, so no surprises. what can i say&#63; MJ IS organic chemistry!",,
"Great Professor. He makes the material clear and writes challenging tests to punish lazy and dumb people. If you meet anyone who complains about this class there is a 90 percent chance that they were not smart enough to take it. If you want to be challenged and learn a lot of interesting material, this is the man to see.",,
His new innovative methods of teaching keep me interested. He's a hard professor but he puts the work in. He will be idolized by many. He's great!,,
One of the few great professors at NYU. I enjoy his style of teaching much more than Fishman and if you read before class...you basically will know exactly what he is talking about. Students that complain basically don't open the book. Definately not impossible to get an A and a B is a piece of cake. MJ is a legend! Enjoy him while u can.,,
"Prof. Jones at first comes across as a sweet, enthusiastic man. As his student, however, you will find that he not only creates exams with the intention of discouraging as many students as possible, but he also is totally unavailable and assumes that you have 37 hours a day to devote to basking in the glory of his textbook. Chances are, you'll fail",,
"His lectures are really interesting, and he has excellent mastery of the course material. His tests are challenging, but if you do a lot of practice problems, you will do well. The only improvement would be for him to vary the lectures more from what he has written in his textbook.",,
His lectures are amazingly clear. I love the way he teaches. He is my favorite professor so far.,,
"Hella of a good teacher, explains stuff.. but he needs to talk louder and write BIGGER! I love his outfit! (he has one lol) Good book, basically just read it and u'll be ready for lecture. Fishman's gone baby! lol His cis(ters) name is Hilary Lincoln Jones.. By the time ur done with orgo, u'll be living , breathing, and speaking orgo.. Good Luck",,
Great professor...Jones should teach the class himself so there is less confussion on exams. harsh grader but gives fair exams,,
"MJ is an awesome lecturer and knows exactly what he is talking about. It was a refreshing change from the typical bore of lectures. Hard course but putting time into it, you will do well. Listen in lecture because he definately gives hints for the exams. Overall great professor.",,
"Dr. Martichuski is extremely insensitive. She treats you like you are an idiot if you don't understand something. She also only has office hours for 40 minutes a week, super rude in email, and made a girl cry in class. The two girls I have class with have failed her class once, and I am fighting to get by so I never have to take her again.",,
"I took gen psych in hs and received an A and then came to college and took it again and barely got a C. She goes off topic all the time and talks about weed all the time or religion. Her test do not reflect anything that we were taught in class or given for practice. Her clicker questions are pretty fair, but not on the test. DO NOT TAKE HER.",,
"For this psych stats class, ATTENDANCE IS A MUST! Professor Martichuski's LA's disagreed with her teaching method and exams so going to help for them this semester was extremely difficult. Get ready to teach yourself.",,
"It seems like she wants you to fail, she's always saying if you didn't do well on so and so you should just drop the class. Not encouraging in the slightest and while she can be funny, she comes off as mean more than anything.",,
"I thought her class was difficult, but overall I understood everything and did just fine.",,
"I loved taking Psych 1000 with Dr. Martichuski. She is so funny and gives really great examples in class. Her tests and quizzes are all online which rocks and if you do the assigned work and come to class, her classes aren't difficult at all. I miss having her as a prof, and would definitely take another class she teaches. Highly recommend.",,
She sucks get ready to fail if you're bad at math,,
"Diane is awesome! She makes her lectures fun and interesting and even creates note outlines that you can print and take with you to class. But, going to class definitely helps because some of her test questions are on things she said in class that aren't necessarily in the notes. Overall, I loved the class.",,
"20% quizzes, 20% each on 3 exams, 20% final. Offers 10 points of extra credit out of 500 for the class. Doesn't specify what will be on the exam, but you can go to her to defend your answers on exams and SHE WILL GIVE YOU CREDIT BACK.",,
Loved loved loved her class! Would take again and recommend to anyone,,
"Really good solid professor. Usually reachable via email and if not her TA is quick to respond then she will follow up. I took her online class which was really clearly explained through her lecture slides. The online textbook was helpful supplemental material. She has tests that make you think, but she prepares you with good study guides & practi",,
I don't understand why everyone is giving her such negative reviews. Yes you have to read a little (the text book is online and you have the choice to listen) and go to the lectures her amazing humor makes class extremely interesting and it's not hard to pay attention. The tests are also online and open note making her class not very hard.,,
"Class is based on 500 points, if you do bad on one thing you're screwed her lectures don't help if you want to do well you have to spend time on reading the textbook over and over.",,
"Dr. S-M does really know her stuff, but unless you show up to class every day, take detailed notes, and read the *entire* textbook, you WILL do poorly on the tests. Since it is a freshman level class, she seems more concerned with scaring freshmen into good study habits (by having dis-proportionally hard tests) than she is with the actual material.",,
Diane was a really fun professor. Her lectures are full of stories and go all over the place but it keeps lecture notes interesting.,,
"Great at providing an interesting and relevant overview of psych. Entertaining lectures, never felt lost or bored.",,
"Wonderful woman who works hard to help the students who want to learn, but you have to put in the effort. If you're looking for an easy A this is not the professor to chose, but if you're looking for someone to invest time into your future and teach things applicable to the 'real world' Diane is the prof for you. Also hilarious teacher/lectures.",,
"I don't doubt that Diane knows her stuff, because she does. That's evident in her lectures, however she is so scatterbrained and all over the place with her lectures. Her slides are minimal and hard to follow. She does not do a good job of outlining important points in lecture. Made me not want to go to class or office hours.",,
"I go to lectures for the extra credit clicker points, but don't pay attention. Her lectures are pretty boring in my opinion. I usually study the day before the test by reading the text book and do pretty well(B+). The only homework is reading (if you actually do it) and experiments. Lots of extra credit.",,
Dr. Martichuski is a fun teacher to have. Just take notes and you should be fine.,,
"Martichuski is very funny. She kind of talks about potentially offensive things often, but she never insults anyone. Classes are super easy and she even provides study guides for your notes. She gives so much extra credit you'd have to try to fail. Clickers are the majority of your grade, so make sure you go. Over all, loved this class.",,
Love this women as a teacher. Class is very interesting and she is super funny. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU LOVE TAKING HARD TESTS. Her tests are impossible to do well on unless you pay 107% attention in class and read the text book 7 times over.,,
"My college experience has worsened from this class. She speaks about irrelevant topics and decides to include her personal beliefs as if they are facts. Miss 4 on a test C. Her lectures have absolutely nothing to do with what is on the test. Which are, by the way, the only things in the grade book. The book does her job for her. What a joke.",,
"Ive had Diane four times now. She takes a tough, no nonsense approach. If you show that you care about the subject, she will care about you and your grade. One of the best psych teachers out there. Take her class and be ready to learn.",,
"Worst teacher I have ever had in my life. Rude beyond belief, discouraging, and extremely condescending. Her information is incorrect and she is very confusing. TA's were extremely disorganized and unhelpful. Do not recommend any class with her.",,
"She told the class she hadn't taught Social Psych in a while, but she did a fantastic job. She really knows what she's talking about, and even incorporates current events into her lectures to help students better connect to the themes of the class. I thought she was also pretty hilarious. And she made the class super interesting. 1010.",,
"There's no homework whatsoever. Tests are all multiple choice. Really easy class, especially if you took AP psych in highschool. Martichuski is hilarious and knowledgeable.",,
She sucks. If you miss one word she says in class your at risk for getting a test question wrong. You have to take more notes than whats just on her slides if you want to do well. Her assignments are easy and if you do them you will get 100 but her tests are purposely written to screw you over. I would not recommend taking this class with her.,,
Test questions are much different then what she says they will be. Clicker questions are easy and tests are totally opposite.,,
"Martichuski isn't for the faint of heart. Her lectures are concise, though she can get off topic when she tells funny stories or anecdotes. She can be a tough grader, but her criteria is clear from day one. Reading the book is important for a good grade, but not necessary to pass. Lectures are a must. Her sense of humor isn't for everyone.",,
Lectures were entertaining but worthless. Lots of boring reading that was not discussed much in class. Especially bad thing about her is how she plants politics into her lessons. She passed off some very political statements as if they were part of the lesson.,,
"She is the worst professor I've had had, hands down. Her final was nothing like her other tests so be prepared to be in for a surprise. She is extremely rude and condescending. Her grading policy makes absolutely no sense. This is why so few people pass the class.",,
"get ready for the hardest tests you will have to take as a psych student, even with accommodations for extra time, they were miserable. and the final? you better start getting ready weeks before, open notes won't even help you on this one",,
"Definitely go to class. Reading the textbook isn't absolutely essential, I got by without doing much reading, but I did all the homework.. If you need help, I recommend asking the TA's in lab or office hours. I like her videos at the beginning of class and her lectures are decent. Study for the tests.",,
"Super funny, class is interesting, but her tests are very difficult whether you understand the content or not. Tests you on textbook readings so it's essential to have",,
"Her lectures are really interesting, but her tests are painfully hard. If you do not read the book, you will not pass the class. Her exams are so specific that if you forget a single detail, you will get it wrong. Overall, I would not suggest taking this class with her.",,
She gets a little off track during lectures so you're required to read the book on the stuff she missed on the chapters we are going over for the test.,,
"Martichuski is hands down one of the funniest professors I have ever had. She works hard to make class fun and interesting. One of the few lecture hall classes I actually enjoyed going to. However, make sure you read the textbook! Tests are multiple choice but definitely difficult.",,
"Dr. Martichuski obviously knows her stuff, but she is definitely the most condescending professor that I have had. If you don't understand something the first time, be prepared to be ridiculed publicly in front of the entire class.",,
"I thought Dr. Martichuski was incredibly fair, and worked hard to help students with the very fast paced summer course. Though the course is challenging, you feel like she does she can to help you 'Get' the material.",,
I loved her class but don't expect to do well. You HAVE to do all the work and read EVERYTHING she tells you to. Her tests are extremely specific and rely heavily on the book. Go and see her at office hours though. I got a D on the first test and then went to talk to her and she dropped the grade cause I got B's on the last three tests.,,
"Diane is incredible smart and knows statistics. However, She sometimes goes too fast so don't expect to just go to class and get it. YOU have to work to get the grade you want- READ THE BOOK. However, if you go to Diane's office and talk to her shes super helpful and is reasonable at adjusting test grades! Just go talk to her!!!!!",,
Don't waste your time.,,
"I absolutely LOVE Dr. Martichuski, such a wonderful person. She really wants her students to succeed and makes class as interesting as possible considering it's statistics. The class itself is not easy but she is fully aware of that and does what she can to help. All attendance is extra credit so go to class and pay attention and you will do fine",,
Her class is incredibly hard. She doesn't give any of her students opportunities to do well. She's very adamant on people dropping her class if they do poorly. You have no time to complete her HARD tests.,,
"Her tests are fill-in-blank and problems ONLY, and far too little time (45 questions/problems in 90 mins!) to be fair. I studied hard for 6+ days on the first test, watched the lectures several times, understood it well & did all the homework. If you need more processing time on tests, RUN AWAY. Sad, because I actually enjoyed the material!",,
This class is easy to get a B if you pay attention in class. you need to read to get an A. She shows a lot of The Big Bang Theory and other funny videos in class. Go to her office after a test to make sure there aren't more than one correct answer though. Free points at the end.,,
"She knows the material inside and out but is terrible at explaining it. Slides are incomplete and jump around, and concepts on tests are impossible to study for and don't follow lecture. First 2 tests and final are incredibly difficult, 3rd test is ok. Tests barely fit time given so if you're a slower test taker you're going to run out of time.",1,
She enjoys filling her lectures with examples that explain very easy concepts and quickly skims over the complex material. Attendance gives you extra credit and she puts these examples on the exams. She also puts very specific details from the textbook onto the tests. If you want an A you will have to read the book.,1,
"Great professor. Wonderful examples, made all of the concepts in statistics and methods so much easier to understand. I took the summer course and got an A. It was a lot of work, but she's fair with her grading and is a great speaker. The lab was nice as well because we were allowed to have a 'cheat sheet' that had all of the commands for R.",1,
Amazing! I love my general psych class. She creates outlines so that its much easier to take notes. She pauses at times to allow us to finish writing any notes down. She is very helpful!,1,
"I really like her, but I feel like I have not learned anything new. My high school psychology class covered more information than she did.",1,
"Terrible, DO NOT TAKE HER STATS SUMMER CLASS. WARNING. Homework is decent and class is fine, but exams are HARD. Studied too much, got a terrible grade.",0,
Tons of extra credit but exams are super hard and hard to get A's,1,
"For a terrible class like statistics, she does a pretty good job at making it comprehensible and at times almost slightly interesting. If you really try, you will get a good grade. I ended up with an 82.7, but she rounded up to a B, which shows that she wants you to succeed. I also had her for gen psych, and she was AMAZING.",1,
"Worst teacher I've had at CU. I've never met a professor that makes themselves less accessible than this woman. If she thinks threats, intimidation, and disinterest are ways to be a helpful resource, she's wrong. Do not take her stats class.",1,
She can't even explain the most basic material.,0,
"She was a good professor, but she had some stupid quirks. For example, she would persistently stop class to tell people to put their electronics away (including electronics) which was very disruptive.",0,
"Even though she offers EC, her exams are too hard and she will not throw out questions even if everybody gets them wrong. Essay questions. I study like 5 days in advance I get Bs on them. Good luck",1,
There is this one kid in the class that ALWAYS asks questions. This is fine EXCEPT that the class has literally turned in to a 1-on-1 conversation between them that does not involve anyone else and usually takes up the majority of the class.,1,
"The actions of Dr. prove how the academic system is truly unfair. She gave me a low grade on my final exam essay and when i asked her why she said it was because i only provided 4 answers to the question instead of 10. There was no indication on the exam of how many answers to give, she said i should have just assumed.I got a C for that",1,
"Great professor, sadly you really should go to her lectures to get an A.",0,
"Easy class, but the test questions were often vague.",1,
"I didn't put in much effort for this class and still got an A-. Didn't read. Make sure to get all the extra credit, attend lecture and recitation because she does take attendance through clickers every day. If you think a test question is unfair she will likely agree and give you points. Easy to do well and she will help you if you seek her help.",1,
I was in the Libby RAP program and she was the best. You have reading assignments from the book that will help you a lot on the tests. She's extremely encouraging and has a lot of great stories and examples to help you remember the materials. She also loves when people come to office hours. I'd definitely recommend her!,1,
"Going to class is very beneficial as she often puts questions on the test that you would only know from attending lecture. Her tests consist of 80% lecture and 20% book, but I've never opened the book and have gotten high grades on the test. It's pretty easy and not time consuming at all if you go to class.",1,
Loved her!,0,
She traumatized me for LIFE when it came to statistics and research class! She is intimidating and the class was really tough. She does not seem to care for the students who tries really hard to do well in this class.,1,+
"I LOVED this class! She explained the material well and made the lectures very pleasurable. If you attend every class and recitation, pay attention, and get the 20 extra credit points that are available, you are bound to do well. Great class and I highly recommend her!",1,
"Yeah, not a huge fan. I got an A, but only because I got extra credit and didn't miss any classes or recitations. The tests suck enormously. There are so many vague and confusing questions. Bleh. But lectures are entertaining.",1,
"Diane is awesome!!! She is always available to offer help and gives you everything you need to get an A in her classes. If you don't get an A it's because you're lazy and incompetent. She wants her students to succeed more than anything else, so she holds you to a high standard, but gives you everything you need to reach it.",1,
Great professor!! First psychology class ever and loved it. Love her enthusiasm for what she teaches..has great stories and makes everything clear. Tests very easy as well!,1,
"I got an A in this class and I still was baffled by the grades I would get on her tests. Her tests lack clarity to the point that they seem purposefully deceitful and hostile. I have no difficulty with hard tests, but I want questions that strays less into the realm of subjectivity.",1,
"HATE this teacher. I took her for social and had to miss a test for an academic contest, and she made it SO difficult for me to take it early. Managed an A-. Year later in her stats class I had to miss a lot of class when a family member got a terminal illness. I got high grades on every test but I was going to fail based on attendance. Had to drop",1,
Worst professor... EVER,0,
"Just because she may not have a warm and fuzzy personality doesn't mean she's trying to trick you or make you fail. She's very thorough in lecture. Her tests are on EXACTLY what she covers in class. She has tons of office hours. Is she sugary-sweet&#63; No. But is she intelligent, quick witted, and enthusiastic about the material&#63; Definitely.",1,
teacher if you are reading this i hope for the sake of your future students that you start to put in a little more effort as a professor. You are a smart lady but did not provide a single shred of assistance every one of the 4 or 5 times i came up to you after class. It seemed like you really just didnt care.,1,
"Great teacher, made this topic tolerable and even a little fun. Did not own book, but managed to do all the HW just fine, which means she explained the material in a practical way and provided all the info needed to learn. Pros are: fun, energetic, organized, fair, caring. CONS: Notes are light, concept tests are HARD and confusion. Tests feel 80's",1,
"Avoid at all costs, unless you are an over achiever. I recieved two A's on exams, and because I never came to class, she felt the need to average them out with two D's. She takes off way too many unneeded points if she feels you are doing too well, while not coming to her class.",1,
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. She tries to trick you on tests and does not explain the information very well. She likes to tell stories instead of explaining the information. If you take the same class with other professors you WILL get a better grade.,1,
Mind numbing lectures. Tends to go off on long personal rants. Power point slides are outdated and boring. You really need to be alert in this class to learn. Exam questions often hinge on minute detail discussed in lecture. Take PSYC 1001 from another professor if possible.,1,
The best teacher I have had in Years.,0,
"amazing teacher, go to class get an A... very laid back personality and easy to get along with",0,
"If you don't know what mean, median and mode are when you start this class you should probably go back to middle school. This is the easiest class I have ever taken. I don't OWN or read the book. I go to class and do the homework on time (note: she gives you the answers to all of the homework problems before they are due - they are free points).",1,
"Stats and Research methods was definately something i had to work at but it wasn't as bad as i thought. You HAVE to go to class and turn in homework. Lab starts halfway through semester, and you have to go as well. The first lab class will go over your head, but once you get it its basically all building off of itself. I got an A-",1,
"Probably the hardest, most confusing class I've ever taken. She moves extremely fast, teaches different methods and formulas than the book, and her tests are torture. never miss class, never miss lab, read every chapter, do every hw...now, is that too much to ask&#63;!",1,
"Stats sucks, but her class makes it a little more bearable, lol. Go to lecture and lab!! If you do, you'll be fine. Kind of socially awkward prof but very passionate about the subject and genuinely nice and helpful-if you do the work.",1,
funny,0,
shes really funny and makes class interesting.. you have to read the book in order to get a remotely good grade on the exams,0,
"This class is definitely a challenge but the Prof. is very knowledgeable. Go to class and pay attention and the material will make more sense. Overall, a pretty good class",1,
"You have to do the work, but if you do, you will be fine. Don't skip any classes, and do all homework on time.",1,
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This is not comming from a student who failed and is taking it out on a website.this lady is cold blooded. mid terms had class averages such as 61 and she does NOT CURVE. she makes class unintresting and painful. your hw is not graded and you do not know if you do it correctly. worst teacher i have ever had, hands down",0,
"pretty tough class, about half the students dropped after the first test. nice lady though.",0,
Her class was a lot of fun. She always had great stories to use as examples.,1,
she is terrible and very rude when you are in need of assistance,1,
bad prof!!,0,
"She presents material in an easy, straight-forward manner. She makes me laugh amost every class.",1,
made me wanna go to class to hear her funny little comments. her outlines are the most helpful thing EVER and her tests are way easy.,1,
"Great prof, funny in class, yet still teaches the material well.",1,
"very thorough, helpful, and clear as possible. Not COMPLETELY relatable",0,
"Very interesting, very very clear. Everything is straightforward and nothing is sneeky. Good teacher, good class.",1,
"A very interesting professor. Thorough, but doesn't focus on just the minutiae. Wears the craziest print clothing, and has a deep and abiding love for what she teaches. All in all, pretty cool.",0,

"She was a great professor. Loved how she put the notes online, made it easy to follow along during lecture. Do the experiments early; it's worth it for the extra credit. Exams were fair; go over her old ones online because they're pretty similar. Great class!",1,
"good overall professor, take advantage of extra credit",1,
"She is a good prof, she is always energetic and happy to be teaching, very clear, lots of videos, clear powerpoint notes which are in an outline that you can print and use to study, or for notes. There are also practice tests online and the tests are easy if you attend class. Extra credit opps too",1,
This class is easy...everything on the tests is on the outlines she gives you to take notes from lecture on.,1,
"Statistics is awful, but she makes it much more manageable, especially if you are not fond of math! She is so helpful and VERY ORGANIZED!! If you go to lecture and recitation you will be fine!",1,
"She's clear and especially effective considering the class was 410 people. Go to the lectures and the class is easy. She goes out of her way to supplement the lectures with videos, speaker panels, etc.",1,
Two words- Jodie Foster,0,

"For a large class, she taught effectively with great study (or lecture) guides. She also provided many supplemental examples of topics (video clips, speaker panels, easy to understand models, etc.)",1,
Could have taught hte class better myself,0,
"She is a phenomenal sociologist, but her classes aren't for the lazy. Deviancy in US Society was a hard class, especially exams, but if you read the book and take notes in lecture, it's passable. The TA's and ATA's are a valuable resource. She isn't that helpful, but that's what the TA's are for. Doing well in recitation helps a lot on exams.",1,
Rude and stupid hard tests. Not a nice person.,0,
"Definitely not an easy class, but you get a giant note card for very test to reference. Go to class, take notes, and put all your notes on the note card. I never actually studied, but i always made the notecard, and always did fine on the test. Also always do the homework. It comes in handy later.",1,
terrible teacher,0,
"Avoid her at all costs. Her class is incredibly hard to follow, her power points provide no info, and the book is very hard to understand and read. Her exams and grading are also in some weird format that has to be perfect or you lose points on the test.",1,
"If you are dedicated to working hard in this class, you will do well. Not for lazy people looking for an easy A.",1,
"She is an incredibly intelligent and outgoing person, and an amazing professor. Her stories are entertaining and this was one class I actually looked forward to going to!",1,
I had the honor of taking Deviance in US Society. Using her real world research studies brings to life real & honest issues. Some of the subject topics may be non-standard. That which makes us uncomfortable isn't something to be afraid of or to be shunned from the classroom. These types of discussions allow people & societies to grow & progress.,1,
"Easily the realest, most interesting class I've ever taken. She is a fantastic professor and is very engaging. Lecture was always very funny and it was not a chore to attend like some are.",1,
This was one of my favorite classes its sad how the university no longer values academic freedom among their staff and forced her into retirement.,0,
She was one of the best teachers I've ever had! Her classes are captivating and interesting to listen to! It's unfortunate that the university has decided to part ways with her though. She was a really great teacher who knew her stuff!,1,
"This is her favorite class and is extremely passionate about it. I never got bored in lecture, but it easy to get distracted in a 500 student lecture. Lecture slides consist of 50% of tests, textbook lists make up the other 50%. Read the textbook, make an organized test note card, and go to recitation to do well!",1,
"SUCH an interesting class! All we talk about is prostitutes and drugs. She is a great teacher- she's very funny and relatable. As long as you read and go to lecture, you will pass. Take [TA] as your TA- she is so passionate and informative.",1,+
"If you go to class, make a good notecard for the tests, and do all of the reading lists from the textbook there is no way you won't do well in this class, you just have to try and pay attention and be good at applying knowledge because the tests aren't multiple choice.",1,
"Very interesting class. However, you need to understand the test format and what they are asking to do well. Your notecard is your life saver. She is a wonderful professor, but don't skip this class. It is not that hard to get an A in the class, just make sure your notecard is thorough and write super small.",1,
She is so awesome! Her class is truly interesting and she is quite a character herself. This is a tough course especially for students used to being tested by multiple choice exams. She uses a short response and essay format for her exams which requires students to truly understand the material in order to succeed. An A is totally possible!,1,
She has been my favorite professor at the University of Colorado. She has a great way of making the class very interesting. I found the class fairly easy because of how interesting it was.,1,
Before taking this class I was mostly uninterested in studying Sociology. This class was a game-changer for me. I absolutely loved this class and found everything discussed interesting and applicable to the real world. Every student at CU should take this class!,1,
I had her for Deviance which is an amazing class! I thought it would just be another boring core class but i loved it! She is hilarious and you learn a lot of really cool information. Take this class if you can! You wont regret it and you'll have an awesome time laughing every time you're in her lecture! I loved her class!,1,
Professor is great! She is very knowledgeable and always keeps lecture interesting (you will NOT be bored.) She is really understanding and helpful. This class is a must take!!,0,
She is one of the best professors I've had at CU. She was great at lecturing and making things comprehensible. Everything we discussed in class was of importance. She was very good at using different examples in her lectures to help give you a better grasp on the concept or idea being discussed. I highly recommend taking a class of hers!,1,
"Great professor, wonderful sense of humor, someone who knows what they are talking about, applies the learning to real life.",1,
my favorite class at CU so far! She is an amazing professor and ties her own experiences into her teaching which makes the class even more interesting,1,
Best professor I have had in my college career. Most amazing class I have taken. I have never learned more in one semester. Dr. has a true passion for teaching and is an absolutely amazing educator.,1,
She is one of the most influential and outstanding professors at the university of colorado. She takes a legitimate interest in students opinions and grades. She is at the same time hilarious as well as brilliant in her teaching abilities. I only wish more professors were like her.,1,
She is an awesome professor. She not only is able to relate class material to her students lives but she also is able to keep her students attention by keeping lectures and readinds interesting. I would tell my friends to take this class even though it is difficult. You will gain insight to your way of life,1,
She is an amazing teacher. She is a very engaging speaker and really makes it worthwhile to come to class. She is easily one of the best professors that I have had at CU. I have taken two classes with her and plan on taking as many more as I can. She's awesome!,1,
"She is a great prof, with a super interesting class. with that said in no way shape or form is this an easy class. This should be a upper division class, and that amount of time and effort you put into this class will blow your mind when you get the test and still know nothing on it. DO NOT take her lightly! she runs a hard class!",1,
Her Deviance in US Society class is a HUGE undertaking. Lots of reading. Going to class and doing the reading will not get you an A in the class. Overall a bit too much for an intro class.,1,
"She is not the ideal professor. She is rude, and also makes HER books that she wrote mandatory and you are unable to sell them back--and their rather pricey. The TAs do all the work, most of the learning takes place in the labs. Her exam format is awful and notes are not posted and hard to follow. I don't recommend this class.",1,
"Lots of reading, but not too difficult class if you keep up with the work. Plus, she's entertaining as hell.",1,
Very fun and interesting class! The stories and readings are very interesting as well!,1,
"This class is challenging, but if you are able to do the reading and attend class you will do fine. Make sure you fill out the notecards for every exam. She shares very personal, interesting, and relevant stories during lecture, you must attend",1,
The first test is going to scare the crap out of people but you really got stick with it because it gets easier! And the first test always has a huge curve! Her lectures are entertaining and MANDATORY. You will fail the test if you do not go to lecture. Bring laptop to take notes in class. Way too hard to get everything if you hand write,1,
I honestly thought this class would be fun! I was right until the first exam came along. The exams ARE HARD HARD HARD. I read all the material and still got a BAD grade. She makes her exams too hard for a 1000 level course. The lectures are fun buuuuuut the most common grade in the class is a D and not worth taking (in terms of your GPA).,0,
"Teacher is the CRAZIEST! She is very interesting and I loved going to every class. However, the tests are completely essay and a bit difficult. But if one utilizes their note card right the tests can seem super easy! I recommend this class!",0,
Her tests are extremely hard and take way too long. She makes the TAs take points off for the dumbest things. If you take the class APPLY ONLY. DO NOT DEFINE! I made that mistake and got practically no points on one portion of the test all because I applied and defined. She knows her stuff but doesn't teach it very well.,1,
Fun teacher. There is so much information packed into the course it became too much at times. I wish it slowed down and that she would explain things better. I really enjoyed the class though and the different types of prostitutes class down by the T.A.'s was hot,0,+
"One of the craziest professors you will ever meet. you allowed a note card on exam days, however every exam that i took went for 3-4 hours.",0,
"I absolutely HATED this class! She's so weird, her tests were INSANELY hard, I spent $80 on her book that I can't sell, and I honestly got NOTHING out of taking this class other than a C on my transcript and I am a student that typically gets A's and B's. If you're considering taking this as an elective, I suggest you find another class!",0,
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I took this class as an elective and barely got away with passing and it really brought down my GPA. The tests are ridiculously hard, especially the first one because the TAs are really unclear about what kind of things they expect in your answers. Taking this class was one of the worst decisions I've ever made.",1,
She is great! She tends to get off topic a little bit but she knows what she's talking about and gets the point across really well. Her tests are pretty hard but as long as you put all of the notes from lectures and recitation on your notecard you'll do well. GO TO CLASS!!!,1,
"Lectures were exciting and she was very knowledgeable, but the tests were way harder than they needed to be. It's a 1000 level course, get over yourself.",1,
Lectures are awesome. Honestly the most gruesome tests on campus. Each test the fastest kid leaves after 2 1/2 hours and the last kid after 4 hours. FOR A MIDTERM!! Hard class because the tests are really hard even though you do get a 5x8 notecard,0,
This class was such a waste of time! Tests were really hard and they were all about applying definitions from her book which you'll never care about again once the test is over. The only sort of good thing about this class was her ridiculous lectures. She's one strange woman. I do not understand why this class is so popular!,1,
"This woman has done too many drugs. She is funny on occation- but not what alot of ppl build her up to be. horrible at getting to the point. I dropped deviance in society cause it got ridiculous- YOU HAVE TO READ her whole book, attend lecture, and study your hooha off to get B! Good material-but not worth it. DID I MENTION THE TESTS ARE DEVIENT&#63;",0,+
"Best class, never wanted to miss it. If your interested at all in deviant behavior and a fun learning experience, she is it!",1,
"READ THE BOOK. this will help immensely on tests and if you read, you wont need to memorize cuz the material in the book is so interesting that its going to be embedded in your head. definitely go to lecture. she makes class fun and interesting with her insane analogies and presentations.",1,
"She is AMAZING! She is crazy, wild teacher, but is so interesting, you will never want to miss class! Exams can be tough, but if you go to class, you will do just fine.",1,
"She is hilarious and her class is a lot of fun. If you can catch the stuff that she says in class,can understand her(she tends to talk really fast), and take good notes both in class and in resitation, you can get a decent grade in her class. Plus, she's just interesting to listen to.",1,
Plan on spending many hours studying for her tests. Be prepared to memorize INSANE amounts of information that you will inevitably forget soon after because it is all about memorization rather than understanding the concepts. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.,1,
everyone on this thing is out of their mind. She had a good class and it wasn't that hard as long as you showed up to recitation and lecture. Take this class if you want an easy b or a,1,
This class was completely useless. Tests are 3-4 hours long and very subjective. The book can't be sold back because she writes new editions. You need to attend and take notes at every lecture and rec. because a lot wasn't covered in the book and the test is on EVERYTHING. Her lectures are enjoyable but are all writing.,1,
"The concepts in the class are simple, but useless to try to learn. Completely a regurgitation class, but you have to go to EVERY class and write EVERYTHING she says in the order she says it. Copying the notes of the board isn't enough, you need to copy what she says. If you are just trying to complete a core requirment - dont take this.",1,
"This has to be the worst class i have taken at CU. Every time we go to class we get a whole bunch of lists that just make a simple topic more complicated and less intresting. The tests are obserdly long and the people who have enough will power to get through the test with out losing their mind are the only ones to do good, there are not many.",1,
I think of this woman as comparable to Hitler.,0,+
Could have been interesting but turned out to bea bunch of stupid lists.,0,
"Worst professor i've ever had. She makes up half of the material, she never wears a bra. discousting. Very bad tests",0,+
good,0,
"She is a self-absorbed egomaniac, her Deviance class is filled with her life accomplishments interspersed with wacked out theories and an occasional swear word--which is only entertaining to the inexperienced freshmen. I left class with nothing more than writer's cramp from the four hour exams--its a 1000 level class, get a grip lady!",0,+
Hardest tests EVER! You get to take in a notecard but its not like a cheat sheet since the questions are all situations that test conceptual knowledge. Differences between different terms are minute and she definitely picks out the difficult discrepencies to test on in her questions. GREATEST CLASS EVER! Everything is both interesting and useful.,1,
"not as smart as she thinks she is, loser.",0,+
hardest tests i have ever taken,0,
"She is hands-down the most amazing professor I've ever had. The tests test you on conceptual knowledge, and she let FA06 use a notecard on the exam, so it's not all about memorization. It's about understanding. She's a genuinely nice woman with incredible knowledge and a fantastic sense of humour. I will keep in touch with her for a long time.",1,
"deviance is all textbooks, exams are very annoying to study for and they take forever to take but she grades easily. its too much work to take as an elective but shes like no other teacher in boulder.",0,
"I ended up HATING this class. Her tests are memorizing a bunch of pointless lists. Her TA's graded sooooo hard. The guy took off points left and right b/c I didn't say exactly what he wanted me to. I should have complained. Should have fought the unfair grading more. But I didn't, and now my GPA suffers. I would never EVER recommend her.",1,
She's alright,0,
Took Social Deviance w/ her. Entertaining lectures. Heavy reliance upon tests for total grade. Much memorizing. Very interesting book; easy to read. Tests themselves are a bit overdone but are nevertheless fun and creative. Occasional frustrating confusion about what is desired on a test -- different input from different TA's = questionable,1,
No Comments,0,
"i agree, she definitely does not know as much as she thinks she does. if you can memorize, you'll be fine.",0,
"she's not as smart as she thinks she is, but I really like her much prettier and more talented sister Kyra.",0,+
"halirious! out of her mind, but so fun. she can go over the material a little fast at times, but is the most accessible prof i've had in a huge lecture such as this. i think shes good - i wanna be friends with her!",0,
"Great class. The best class i've taken at CU thus far. However, tests are hard, but it's worth it. Great professor. She has a lot of experience in the stuff she teaches. Hilarious stories.",1,
"this class is one of the most interesting classes i've ever taken...great professor, a little crazy but she keeps you interested. Only downside-tests are a little hard and lots of memorizing...TAKE THIS CLASS!",0,
She is one of the worst prof's I've ever had-- and what is the annyoing laugh&#63; Her tests are on nothing you cover in class-- and she yelled at someone for being a notetaker...boo,0,
"The Teacher is not very Nice and considers herself a CU celebrity. Class is somewhat interesting, but seems kinda ridiculous they make soo many take it",0,

Tough but great class,0,
"The class is pretty intresting and presented in power point which makes note taking easy. Tests on the other hand suck. They're so looooonnnngggg. But at least the essays are written in a different, shorter form.",1,
"She was one of the best professors I had in college. She is hilarious... sometimes you laugh with her, sometimes you laugh at her. Her class keeps you on your feet. One day we spent the entire hour talking about deviant sexual fetishes. and you've gotta love the teaching assistants dressing up like prostitutes. She rocks!",0,+
"intresting teacher, you can tell she has been on drugs in the past, thank god this class has a recitation or we would all be in serious grade trouble, liked her class but i don't think i wana have her as a teacher again.",0,
"She as a professor is fun, compassionate, intelligent, and knows the material. She's an amazing sociologist. Relies too much on the TA's and recitations at times. Took this class years ago and the tests were pure memorization of definitions. Easy only if you can memorize things. I still quote concepts learned in class in daily life.",1,
GREATEST PROFF... YOULL HAVE SOOO MUCH FUN WITH HER!,0,
the class was awesome and very entertaining but her tests were not worth it! don't take the class or it will lower you gpa.. the tests have NOTHING to do with the material.. so it makes it very difficult for sure!,1,
Such an interesting class. It was hard and a lot of info but you wanted to study it because it was such a different topic.,0,
This class was great. The tests were based on memorizing lists. I would study for a few hours the day before and I got an A in the class. The most important thing is to attend recitaion and lecture so you have all the lists and notes. THe practice test in the book are exactly how the real tests will be. The TA's are a big help too.,1,

"People complain about the tests, but if your one of those people that likes to know exactly what is on the test and you just have to memorize it then the tests are not bad. It is an entertaining class as well too.",1,
"The class was really fun and interesting, but the tests were ridiculous with tons of memorizing. I took the class just as an elective, but it did end up bringing down my GPA. It really depends on how much effort you're willing to put into it",1,
She is awesome and really entertaining.,0,
"She tells some funny stories, but her tests are insanely hard, and the grading on assignments is about as harsh as it gets. Definitely not worth it, and especially not worth it for me, because I took her class 4fun and now its bringing down my gpa!",1,
She is very knowladgeble and a great professor. She has a crazy sense of humor and makes the class extremely entertaining.,1,
She is really wierd and crazy,0,
"His lectures are long and he makes simple concepts confusing through bad examples. The online portion is messed up, I did practice questions and ones I left blank ended up going against my grade. His grading is ridiculous, I was .2 away from an A, and the online factors I didn't know about and wasn't on the syllabus made me get a B. DO NOT TAKE HIM",1,
Lectures and are really long and boring. Test are hard.,1,
"I'm about to finish up microecon with him and so far it's been fairly easy. I went to a total of four lectures (2 of which were the midterms) and I have an A in the course. As long as you read the book and go to recitation, you will be fine. Tests can be tricky for a lot of people but he curves the hell out of them.",1,
I may be biased because this material comes to me fairly easy but I thought he did a great job teaching the course. My advice would be to not miss class. Lots of anecdotes that I thought kept the class from becoming monotonous. Think I'll try and minor in Econ because of the course.,1,
Most people are probably gonna rate him poorly but I think his class was great. At the very least he is entertaining. His lectures weren't great but you will learn if you can pay attention unlike 95% of the class.,0,
"NOT a good professor, super boring not my best choice at all. Tests are super tough so read your little heart out.",0,
"Fantastic teacher. Logical as hell. Great grading system. Rambles in class about sometimes off topic material, but very interesting guy without a doubt. Highly recommend this teacher to anyone wanting to pass Microeconomics. You do not have to attend, DON'T so everyone who does gets better grades. Very competitive curve, 75 avg.",1,
"Professor's tests are quite difficult as they are littered with trick questions. He does curve it based on the overall class average, but you will find it hard to pass if you blow off his class. READ THE BOOK it will save your grade.",1,
"His lectures are incredibly long and make you want to fall asleep. He over complicates simple concepts with a ton of useless, drawn out examples. His tests are very tricky too; The second midterm has a class average of a 53 but he curves like a madman. Reading your textbook will save your semester, STAY CLEAR OF THIS PROF.",1,
"Horrible lectures including topics completely non-related. Tests are ridiculous. None of the homework correlates with the midterms. Terrible teaching. Midterms are multiple choice meaning that if you miss five you get an 80, and lets face it no one can miss just five. Every average ends up a failed grade so why does he continue with this???",1,
Good teachers. Tests just like the practice ones;,0,
"First off, I would definitely not recommend taking any course with him. Online homework has no correlation to tests so studying is very tough. He makes his own presentations which are not related to the homework, textbook or tests so good luck doing even 'decent' with this confusing teacher.",1,
"The textbook he uses is very difficult to follow and is completely different than the Aplia homework but it is easier to follow than his lectures. He loves economics and knows it very well that he assumes that an intro class should be easy. Midterms are ridiculously hard, probably 10x the hw. Average midterm grade was a 53%, take a diff prof",1,
"He is a legend. His lectures are all on point and he keeps you engaged the whole class. He is often behind and gets distracted easily, but he is hilarious. Also its an entry level econ class, you could have a monkey teach it and learn the same thing from a professor that has been teaching their entire career. He is a definite must take.",1,
"Gets off track way too easily, in addition to having very long winded and monotonous presentation of topics",1,
"He loves what he does and you can tell, but it was hard for him to explain something simple, he tends to get very off track to the point you don't want to go to lecture and think you can teach yourself (you can't). His tests are difficult because they have nothing to do with the homework. Be careful of TAs, hit or miss.",1,
He was behind on his lectures the whole semester. Our TAs would assign online homework each week but the things that the homework covered were not even close to what he was lecturing us on that week. Make sure to read the textbook too because the book won't try to make stupid jokes and actually make you understand the material.,1,
He takes forever to explain something simple. He gets off track sometimes.,1,
Lectures in class were only tangentially related to the material in the book. I had to keep cross-referencing because the chapter headlines in my notes didn't match up with the material in the book. Don't assign a book if you're not going to use it. Tests seemed to draw more from microeconomics than the material we learned in class. No homework.,1,
Tests are so hard and do not cover any of the material learned in class 'don't expect to get higher than a 60' as he says...,1,
"Extremely nice and funny guy, however his lectures are boring and throughout the semester many people stop showing up as lectures are not mandatory. Online assignments are challenging, but as long as you read the book and show up to recitations the class is fairly easy",1,
"Lectures are very long and easy to become bored, but not mandatory. As long as you read through the book, his power points online, and study with his practice tests, you should do fine. Funny guy, very chill.",1,
"He is a pretty cool guy, but you really need the book to do well. I pretty much relied on it all semester because his lectures can be long and boring and my TA barely spoke english. I read the book, did the assignments and studied and was still able to pass with an A",1,
"Awesome thing about this class is if you do well on the first two midterms you don't have to take the final. Hardly ever went to class, but still got out of the midterm. You just have to actually read the text book and do the weekly assignments. Sure this gets annoying but its not a big price to pay for never having to go to class. He is cool 2",1,
"You have an assignment every week, and it does not help you what so ever with what you are learning. His lectures are long, and some what hard to follow. In order to even receive a C in his class you have to put in around 20+ hours of work.",1,
"Great professor IF you already know and are interested in ECON. He knows his stuff. Lectures are boring if you've never taken ECON or not very interested in it. For his tests and midterms, make sure you do his old tests posted on his website. Very helpful!",1,
"he knows econ and has the ability to explain it well by using real life examples. Most kids in his class won't get an A, however that's because of the people in the class. He will answer questions you have and is generally a nice guy.",1,
If you like convoluted explanations of relatively easy ideas and terribly worded test questions than he is the guy for you. The best advice I have is to read your text book. That is unless you like the idea of learning things as simple as brushing your teeth in terms of quantum physics in a foreign language.,1,
"He is an awesome person. I've gone into many of his office hours and had a few one on one meetings with him and I couldn't say a bad thing about him as a person. On the other hand his class is way too long, lectures are boring and hard to stay focused in. Homework and quizzes are not terribly hard, but the tests are impossible!!!!",1,
"Although his lectures are way too big, he makes a point to make sure he explains things in a way that most students can understand. His office hours are helpful. On exams, as long as you have done the homework and taken notes, you should do fine. He words his questions a little confusing but they are fairly easy.",1,
"He seems to understand the material for sure, but the class is 10Xs larger than it should be. Very very watered down and he writes very confusing tests.",1,
NEVER TAKE HIS CLASS! Super disorganized and rude. Is a really hard grader,0,
"Lectures with powerpoint, pretty funny and engaging. Has relatable examples and class attendance is worth it. The Powerpoints only supplement his lecture, which he does on his own and you can tell he really knows the material. Occasionally not very clear on some points, but main points are strongly enforced.",1,
"He knows Micro like the back of his hand & wants everyone else to know it too. He is a approachable prof. His lectures are done on an overhead projector, allowing him to deviate from the lesson. His tests are full of trick questions. Does not assign textbook readings. If you don't have previous Micro knowledge, your GPA will suffer.",1,
"Incredibly smart guy! Uses good examples. But VERY unorganized and is very difficult to understand the concepts the way he explains them. The only reason I got a good grade was because I went to another teacher's class, as well, to actually understand the information. Otherwise I would have gotten a bad grade even though I read the book.",1,
"Pretty interesting professor, funny at times. Uses a lot of interesting real world examples. Exams are harder than you'd expect but reading the textbook he wrote is very helpful",1,
"probably one of the funniest profs. loves his opinions, some are offensive, but i find that funny. if you go in for help with the paper he gets real excited, he loves talking about who knows what. missed lots of classes. took little notes. study old midterms. he basically tells you what questions will be asked but changes the words to trip you up.",0,
Awesome Professor. Really funny.,0,
Microeconomics- The man absolutely knows his stuff. It is a tough class but he uses interesting examples and introduces concepts relevant to everyone. Class is difficult if econ isn't your thing. Can't wait to take environmental econ with him!,1,
He is very helpful and knows tons about the material. If you have a real interest in econ take his class,1,
Most unorganized person I have ever taken a class from. His exams do not test you on what you have learned...they are just trick questions. He seemed uninterested in the class and the success of his students. I was initially excited about this class and came away very disappointed.,1,
"If you've taken BCOR finance and ethics this course is a breeze. He talks about discounting cash flows a bunch, and a lot of his arguments are fairly easy to understand. I feel like I learned a lot. He teaches simplified models that help explain why pollution occurs and why it's so hard to measure and control. Great elective for business kids.",1,
"This is not an easy class and it is different from other microeconomic class. If you have zero economic background, it will be very difficult for you. The textbook does not explain everything. You have to learn almost everything on your own. The recitation does not help to prepare for the test. You have to figure out the concept from somewhere else",1,
Class is confusing. Tests are the essentially the exact same ones he has used previously. Do not expect to learn anything from this class,1,
Best economic teacher at CU hands down.,0,
"he was my graduate advisor. While I had to go elsewhere for very technical econometric questions, he was the master at teaching me to think like an economist. A much harder to quantify skill than showing me how to do regressions, but vital none the less.",0,
"Definitely could not understand lectures except for the jokes, which were funny. reading the book and looking over past exams = success. some things arent in the book and are in lecture so at least just copy down everything he write on the overhead.",1,
"very hard professor, taught myself the entire class because i couldnt understand the lectures at all. READ before you come to class, it makes more sense. get tutors. nice curved grading scale but need to work very hard to succeed. tests are killer and 100 percent of your grade",1,
"His micro economics class was unorganized and difficult to follow. The class was based more off of his environmentalist opinions than off of any principles. All that counts is tests, and they cover EVERYTHING.",1,
"He knows how to party. However, he doesn't really know how to teach intro micro so it can be understood.",0,
I took micro economics. He doesn't care about attendance or book reading. Almost everything depends on the exam. If you know the material it's not a super hard exam. But you do need to learn everything he's talking about. His exams covers it all.,1,
"Study the old midterms, and look through the book. AND don't fall into the trap of thinking he's trying to trick you with his questions - pick the most obvious answer (usually E). The questions are all really similar, every semester.",1,
"&quot;The organization of the political system is similar to the organization of a septic tank, the largest chunks float to the top&quot;. 2008. Funny dude & strong defender of his sometimes spurious/pointless arguments. Best class to nap through. Worse part of class were the defiant self-entitled environmentalists. If in doubt, choose E",0,
"Horrible professor, makes no sense in class. No wonder other economists don't understand his theories. Tests are unfair.",0,
ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!,0,
"Go to class for the first few sections (like Supply and Demand stuff) but the rest can be learned in recitation. Also, if you don't get the topic, GO ASK HIM!! even if he's not so helpful in class, it will be 100% more clear if you go to his office hours!",1,
"He sure loves to talk about random things. That said, if you come to class and read the textbook you will do well in that class. The TAs aren't much help, but thats not his fault. Much easier than other econ professors for this course!",1,
He is awesome. If you are taking prin. of microecon take it with him! his lectures are very clear and thorough. Tests aren't very hard and if you do good you dont have to take the final. Much better than other econ 2010 professors,1,
"He mumbles to himself about useless stories like how he likes Jodi Foster and Yager. The only reason I'm surviving his class is because I have THE ONLY teaching assistant who speaks comprehensive english (the rest hardly speak english, more chinese).",0,
Very good professor. Helpful and understandable. Well organized notes. One of the only professors ive had the truely wants to see every student succeed. very refreshing in contrast to most professors and TA's who feel that being an ass is what they are there for.,1,
He is awesome to listen to and as a professor he makes the tests short and simple. He also forms your grade to give you the best possible final grade.,0,
His lectures fill graves. I just had to log in to say that.,0,
No Comments,0,
"The notes barely relate to the tests, as the tests are extremely hard. Most of the answers are E, or when he says &quot;a or c&quot; that is usually the answer. He is a nice guy and he is smart, but he is just a very bad teacher. There are only 2 tests and a final, so your grade can be very low or very high",1,
"he's sort of a funny/crazy guy, which makes lectures somewhat more tolerable, yet hard to follow and the class notes don't make much sense, but if you're good at learning on your own from the book you'll probably do well (the amount of material isn't overwhelming or too hard to grasp). as well as he has a very fair grading policy.",1,
"I feel that he gets a bad rap. He is far too intelligent to be teaching basic Economics classes to immature college students. He has a hard time creating enthusiasm for the subject unless you are already interested in it and the people who speak badly of him are there to try and get by with an easy grade. However, if you pay attention to the lectures or just the notes, an A is easy to obtain. I missed a lot of class and got an A for two different classes of his. He is on the cutting edge.",1,
Easiert math-related class of my life!,0,
He writes the most impossible test about things that don't even make any sence,0,
"He was a really interesting and funny guy with a lot of good examples of microeconomics. If class wasn't at 9:30, it would have been better. The tests are ridiculous with 2 midterms with 20 questions each...that means each question is worth 5% of your grade. It's really easy to do poorly on the tests, but you can do well if you try",1,
Worst professor and class ever.,0,
"He is harder the other econ profs I've had, but go to class and pay attention and you'll get an A. I never went to recitation and managed that. He just makes you think in a different way.",1,
His class is signifigantly harder than any other econ teacher. GET OUT while u CAN!!,0,
"He goes on so many tangents! It is impossible to take notes and then he goes off on the math of how to do things which make no sense. He is occasionally funny and very intellegent, but yeah not so great at the teaching thing.",1,
"He suffers from emotional breakdowns frequently, prompting all other econ professors to look at you with great pity when you mention you took him. Wonderful class, if you are interested in learning about inflated housing prices in Malibu, CA and red wine.",0,

Such a bad bad class.,0,
He was a funny guy but a horendous teacher. All i even remember about his class is him talking about beer and haagan das. oh and mc=mr,1,
"Prof is a very interesting man...if you enjoy hearing the sames stories about beer and 50 cent over and over again, I would recommend taking this class! Overall, his class is manageable",0,
"He's really disoriented, but a really cool guy and funny. A little hard to understand, but if you read the book, and go to recitation, its not that bad.",0,
